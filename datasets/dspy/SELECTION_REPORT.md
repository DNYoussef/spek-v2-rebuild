# DSPy Top 10 Examples Selection Report

## Selection Methodology

This report documents the selection of the top 10 examples from each of the three DSPy training datasets for use as demonstrations in DSPy BootstrapFewShot optimization.

### Selection Criteria (Weighted)

1. **Diversity (40%)**: Prioritize underrepresented categories to ensure broad coverage
2. **Quality of Decomposition (25%)**: Clear, actionable tasks with realistic time estimates and valid dependencies
3. **Real-World Applicability (20%)**: Common development patterns and production-ready scenarios
4. **Teaching Value (10%)**: Demonstrates best practices, edge cases, and critical patterns
5. **Completeness (5%)**: All required fields present and well-structured

### Scoring Algorithm

Each example receives a score out of 100 points:
- **Diversity (40 pts)**: Inverse proportional to category representation
- **Quality (25 pts)**:
  - Complexity (10 pts): Optimal 3-5 subtasks
  - Time realism (10 pts): All tasks 15-60 minutes
  - Dependencies (5 pts): Presence of realistic dependency chains
- **Real-world (20 pts)**: Matches common patterns (auth, payment, API, etc.)
- **Teaching (10 pts)**: Contains educational keywords (edge cases, compliance, security)
- **Completeness (5 pts)**: All required fields populated

## Patterns Observed in High-Quality Examples

### Common Characteristics

1. **Realistic Complexity**: Top examples typically have 3-5 subtasks, avoiding both oversimplification and overwhelming complexity
2. **Time Estimates**: Best examples use realistic 15-60 minute estimates per task
3. **Dependency Chains**: High-scoring examples include logical dependencies (e.g., test migration before rollback)
4. **Production Patterns**: Examples covering OAuth, payments, migrations, and security consistently score high
5. **Quality Gates**: Examples with NASA compliance checks, theater detection, and validation steps teach best practices

### Category Distribution Insights

- **Development Dataset**: Strong emphasis on web development, backend systems, and API integration
- **Quality Dataset**: Balanced coverage of testing types (unit, integration, performance, security, compliance)
- **Coordination Dataset**: Focus on strategic planning, resource allocation, and cross-team orchestration

### Teaching Value Patterns

Examples with highest teaching value include:
- Edge case handling (migrations with rollback, retry logic)
- Security patterns (OAuth, encryption, vulnerability scanning)
- Compliance validation (NASA rules, GDPR, accessibility)
- Performance optimization (N+1 queries, caching, load testing)

## Recommendations for DSPy Training

1. **Use all 30 examples** (10 from each dataset) for comprehensive coverage
2. **Validate demonstrations** before BootstrapFewShot to ensure correctness
3. **Monitor performance** on underrepresented categories after optimization
4. **Consider expanding** dataset if specific patterns show poor optimization
