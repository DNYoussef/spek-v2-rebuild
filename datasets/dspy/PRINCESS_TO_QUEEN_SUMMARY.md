## Training Dataset Design Principles

### 1. **Realistic Scenarios**
- Based on actual software development workflows (OAuth, payments, Kubernetes, ML models)
- Authentic technical challenges (schema conflicts, latency issues, race conditions)
- Real-world decision trade-offs (security vs scalability, cost vs performance)

### 2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- 60% success scenarios (complete workflows, QA passed, coordination successful)
- 30% failure/blocked scenarios (technical blockers, test failures, resource conflicts)
- 10% decision-required scenarios (strategic decisions, trade-offs, budget constraints)

### 3. **Rich Context**
- Quality metrics (NASA compliance, test coverage, performance)
- Cost tracking (estimated vs actual, variance analysis)
- Timeline data (planned vs actual, efficiency)
- Team information (agents involved, tasks coordinated)
- Artifact lists (files created, LOC, tests)

### 4. **Structured Escalation Messages**
- Clear message types (complete, failed, blocked, decision-required)
- Actionable summaries (what happened, why, next steps)
- Detailed context (quality gates, cost, timeline)
- Decision options with pros/cons/cost/timeline
- Recommendations with clear rationale
- Blocker severity and impact analysis

### 5. **Decision Support**
- Multiple options with trade-off analysis
- Quantitative data (cost, timeline, performance)
- Qualitative factors (team expertise, maintainability, risk)
- Historical data when relevant (previous incidents, user research)
- Clear recommendations with rationale

## Usage for DSPy Optimization

### Training Objectives

**Princess-Dev → Queen**:
- Learn to synthesize development progress into clear status reports
- Identify when technical blockers require escalation vs local resolution
- Recognize when strategic decisions need Queen-level approval
- Format recommendations with cost/timeline/impact analysis

**Princess-Quality → Queen**:
- Learn to evaluate quality gates and determine pass/fail
- Identify critical vs non-critical quality issues
- Format test failure reports with remediation guidance
- Recognize when quality trade-offs require decision escalation

**Princess-Coordination → Queen**:
- Learn to aggregate task coordination metrics into progress reports
- Identify resource conflicts and timeline constraints
- Format cost/timeline variance analysis
- Recognize when strategic decisions require C-level approval

### Optimization Strategy

1. **Input**: Princess workflow context (phases completed, agents involved, metrics)
2. **Output**: Structured escalation message to Queen
3. **Optimization Goal**: Generate clear, actionable escalation messages that:
   - Accurately summarize workflow status
   - Highlight critical blockers and decisions
   - Provide quantitative metrics (cost, timeline, quality)
   - Format decision options with trade-off analysis
   - Include clear recommendations with rationale

### Example DSPy Signature

```python
class PrincessEscalation(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate escalation message from Princess to Queen"""

    # Input
    princess_id = dspy.InputField(desc="Princess agent ID")
    workflow_id = dspy.InputField(desc="Workflow identifier")
    status = dspy.InputField(desc="Workflow status: complete, blocked, failed, needs-decision")
    context = dspy.InputField(desc="Workflow context: phases, agents, metrics, artifacts")

    # Output
    message_type = dspy.OutputField(desc="Message type: workflow-complete, workflow-blocked, qa-complete, qa-failed, coordination-complete, decision-required")
    summary = dspy.OutputField(desc="1-2 sentence summary of workflow status")
    details = dspy.OutputField(desc="Structured details: deliverables, quality metrics, cost, timeline, blockers, decisions")
    recommendations = dspy.OutputField(desc="Next steps and rationale")
```

## Next Steps

1. **Load datasets into DSPy**:
   ```python
   import json

   with open('datasets/dspy/princess_dev_to_queen.json') as f:
       dev_data = json.load(f)

   training_examples = [
       dspy.Example(
           princess_id=ex['princess_id'],
           workflow_id=ex['workflow_id'],
           status=ex['status'],
           context=ex['context']
       ).with_inputs('princess_id', 'workflow_id', 'status', 'context')
       for ex in dev_data['examples']
   ]
   ```

2. **Define optimization metric**:
   - Accuracy of message type classification
   - Completeness of escalation details
   - Quality of recommendations

3. **Run DSPy optimization**:
   ```python
   from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot

   optimizer = BootstrapFewShot(metric=escalation_quality_metric)
   optimized_princess = optimizer.compile(PrincessAgent(), trainset=training_examples)
   ```

4. **Evaluate on holdout set**:
   - Reserve 20% of examples for validation
   - Test on new workflow scenarios
   - Measure Queen satisfaction with escalation quality
