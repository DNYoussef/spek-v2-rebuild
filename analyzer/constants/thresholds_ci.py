CI/CD Temporary Thresholds - Technical Debt
============================================

Temporary threshold overrides for CI/CD pipeline compatibility.

**TECHNICAL DEBT WARNING**: These constants are temporary workarounds
to allow the CI/CD pipeline to pass while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Deprecation Plan**:
- Remove in v7.0.0 (6 months post-launch)
- Replace with proper policy-based configuration
- Update CI/CD to use standard thresholds
