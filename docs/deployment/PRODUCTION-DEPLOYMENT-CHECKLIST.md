---

### Step 3: Deployment Execution

**For containerized deployment (Docker/Kubernetes)**:

```bash

docker build -t spek-platform:v2.0.0 .

# 2. Tag image
docker tag spek-platform:v2.0.0 registry.example.com/spek-platform:v2.0.0
docker tag spek-platform:v2.0.0 registry.example.com/spek-platform:latest

# 3. Push to registry
docker push registry.example.com/spek-platform:v2.0.0
docker push registry.example.com/spek-platform:latest

# 4. Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/spek-platform

# 5. Verify deployment
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs -f deployment/spek-platform
```

**For serverless deployment (Vercel, Netlify)**:

```bash
# 1. Install CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# 3. Verify deployment
vercel ls
curl https://spek.platform/health
```

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Image pushed to registry
- [ ] Deployment executed
- [ ] Pods/instances healthy
- [ ] Health check passing

---

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# 1. Check health endpoint
curl https://spek.platform/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok", "version": "2.0.0"}

# 2. Run smoke tests
npm run test:smoke

# 3. Check monitoring dashboards
# - Application errors: 0
# - Response time: <500ms
# - CPU usage: <50%
# - Memory usage: <70%

# 4. Verify performance
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{time_total}\n" https://spek.platform
# Expected: <2s

# 5. Check logs for errors
kubectl logs -f deployment/spek-platform | grep -i error
# Expected: No critical errors
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Health check passing
- [ ] Smoke tests passing
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Performance within SLAs
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards green

---

### Step 5: Traffic Migration (Blue-Green/Canary)

**Blue-Green Deployment**:

```bash
# 1. Deploy to "green" environment
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment-green.yaml

# 2. Verify green environment
curl https://green.spek.platform/health

# 3. Switch traffic to green
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-green.yaml

# 4. Monitor for 15 minutes
watch -n 10 kubectl get pods

# 5. Decommission blue environment (after 1 hour)
kubectl delete -f k8s/deployment-blue.yaml
```

**Canary Deployment**:

```bash
# 1. Deploy canary (10% traffic)
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment-canary.yaml

# 2. Monitor canary metrics (30 minutes)
# - Error rate: <1%
# - Latency: p99 <1s

# 3. Increase to 50% traffic (if healthy)
kubectl scale deployment/spek-platform-canary --replicas=5

# 4. Full rollout (if healthy)
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
```

**Checklist**:

kubectl logs -f deployment/spek-platform
```

**For Docker/Compose**:

```bash
# 1. Stop current version
docker-compose down

# 2. Checkout previous version
git checkout v1.9.0

# 3. Rebuild and restart

```

**For Vercel/Serverless**:

```bash
# 1. List deployments
vercel ls

# 2. Promote previous deployment

# 3. Restore from backup (if data corruption)
psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER $DB_NAME < backup_20251010_120000.sql

# 4. Verify data integrity
npm run migrate:verify
```
