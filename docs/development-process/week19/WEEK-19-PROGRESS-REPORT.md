## Technical Accomplishments

### 1. Context DNA Storage Architecture ✅

**SQLite Schema Design**:
```sql
projects (6 columns)         -- Project metadata
tasks (11 columns)           -- Task execution history
conversations (8 columns)    -- User/agent dialogues
artifacts (10 columns)       -- S3 path references
agent_memories (11 columns)  -- Success/failure patterns
search_index (FTS5)          -- Full-text search
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for concurrency
- Prepared statements for all queries
- Indexes on all foreign keys
- FTS5 with Porter stemming
- Generic search results with type safety

**Storage Efficiency**:
```
30-day retention @ 100 projects:
- Projects: 100 × 1KB = 100KB
- Tasks: 1,000 × 2KB = 2MB
- Conversations: 10,000 × 0.5KB = 5MB
- Artifacts: 500 × 0.3KB = 150KB (paths only!)
- Agent memories: 5,000 × 1KB = 5MB
- FTS5 index: ~5MB (30% overhead)
Total: ~17.25MB (very lightweight)
```

---

### 2. Retention Management System ✅

**Automatic Cleanup Flow**:
```
1. Timer triggers every 24 hours
2. Calculate cutoff: 30 days ago
3. Delete entries older than cutoff
   - Projects, tasks, conversations, artifacts, memories
4. Collect statistics (deleted count, freed bytes)
5. Call optional callback with stats
6. Update last cleanup timestamp
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic disk space management
- Configurable retention period (default: 30 days)
- No manual intervention required
- Performance impact <5s per cleanup
- Callback pattern for monitoring

**Configuration**:
```typescript
const manager = new RetentionManager({
  retentionDays: 30,
  autoCleanup: true,
  cleanupIntervalHours: 24,
  cleanupCallback: (stats) => {
    console.log(`Cleaned up ${stats.totalDeleted} entries`);
    console.log(`Freed ${stats.freedBytes} bytes`);
  }
});
```

---

### 3. Artifact Reference Optimization ✅

**Storage Comparison**:
```
WITHOUT artifact references:
- 1,000 artifacts × 50KB average = 50MB in database
- Slow queries, large backup files, limited scalability

WITH artifact references:
- 1,000 artifacts × 0.3KB paths = 300KB in database
- 99.4% storage reduction
- Fast queries, small backups, unlimited scalability
```

**S3 Path Structure**:
```
artifacts/
├── {projectId}/
│   ├── {date}/
│   │   ├── {artifactId}-{filename}
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...

Example:
artifacts/proj-1/2025-10-09/artifact-1733830400000-SPEC-v8.md
```

**Reference Types**:
1. **S3 Path**: `s3://bucket/artifacts/proj-1/2025-10-09/artifact-123-file.md`
2. **Local Path**: `/path/to/local/file.md`
3. **External URL**: `https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/file.md`
