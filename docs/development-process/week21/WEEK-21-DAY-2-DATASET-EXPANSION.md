## Prompt Engineering Principles Applied

All new examples incorporate principles from [PROMPT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES.md](../research/PROMPT-ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES.md):

### Reviewer Examples:
- **Principle 1** (Clarity & Specificity): Clear, actionable error messages with specific line numbers
- **Principle 6** (Constraints & Boundaries): Security checks, validation requirements
- **Principle 8** (Error Prevention): Proactive identification of failure modes
- **Principle 13** (Address Edge Cases): Path traversal, race conditions, recursion risks
- **Principle 23** (Regulatory Compliance): NASA Rule 10, NIST guidelines

### Coder Examples:
- **Principle 1** (Clarity): Comprehensive docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises
- **Principle 6** (Constraints): Assertions for input validation, type hints
- **Principle 8** (Error Prevention): Proper exception handling, timeout protection
- **Principle 13** (Edge Cases): NaN/Inf checks, transient vs permanent errors
- **Principle 14** (Consistency): Uniform error handling patterns
- **Principle 23** (Regulatory Compliance): NASA Rule 10 (≤60 LOC, ≥2 assertions, no recursion)
- **Principle 24** (Testing Requirements): Observability metrics, comprehensive validation

## DSPy Best Practices Applied

Based on corrected [DSPY-INTEGRATION-STRATEGY.md](DSPY-INTEGRATION-STRATEGY.md):

### 1. Standardized Module Signatures
All new examples use **`task_description` + `objective`** format (Bug #6 fix):
- `task_description`: Complete context (code to review/implement, requirements, constraints)
- `objective`: Focus areas and quality goals

**Old format (Bug #6 - AVOIDED)**:
```python
# Reviewer: code_to_review, review_focus
# Coder: specification, architecture
```

**New format (CORRECT)**:
```python
# All agents: task_description, objective
```

### 2. Quality-Focused Examples
- All examples ≥95% quality (DSPy recommendation: high-quality training data)
- Diverse scenarios (security, NASA compliance, async patterns, distributed systems)
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage

### 3. Proper Output Structures
**Reviewer outputs**:
```json
{
  "overall_score": float,
  "nasa_compliance_pct": float,
  "security_score": float,
  "quality_score": float,
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
      "category": "security|nasa|quality|bugs|performance",
      "description": str,
      "line_number": int,
      "recommendation": str
    }
  ],
  "summary": str
}
```

**Coder outputs**:
```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": str,
      "signature": str,
      "docstring": str,
      "body": str,
      "nasa_compliant": bool,
      "line_count": int
    }
  ],
  "constants": [...],
  "imports": [...],
  "overall_quality_score": float
}
```

### 4. Simplified Metrics (3-7 per agent)
Avoided Bug #4 (verbose signatures) by keeping metrics focused:
- Reviewer: 4 scores (overall, NASA, security, quality)
- Coder: 1 score (overall_quality_score)

## Time Investment

**Dataset Expansion**: 2.5 hours
- Research prompt engineering principles: 30 min
- Create 4 Reviewer examples: 1 hour
- Create 4 Coder examples: 1 hour

**Total Week 21 Time** (including Day 1 remediation): 8 hours
- Day 1 (Bug fixes): 5.5 hours
- Day 2 (Dataset expansion): 2.5 hours

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Train All 4 P0 Agents (RECOMMENDED ✅)

**Time estimate**: 30 minutes (22 min training + 8 min validation)

**Training command**:
```bash
# Train Queen
python -m src.dspy_optimization.train queen

# Train Tester
python -m src.dspy_optimization.train tester

# Train Reviewer
python -m src.dspy_optimization.train reviewer

# Train Coder
python -m src.dspy_optimization.train coder
```

**Expected output**: 4 optimized JSON files in `models/dspy/`

**Success criteria**:
- All 4 agents train without errors
- Validation scores improve ≥5% over baseline
- Optimized modules use ≤5 few-shot examples each

### Option 2: Expand Queen/Tester Datasets First (OPTIONAL)

**Rationale**: Queen/Tester have 9 examples (70% synthetic quality), could benefit from 10 examples at 95%+ quality

**Time estimate**: 2 hours (1 hour per agent)

**Decision**: **NOT RECOMMENDED** - 9 examples sufficient for BootstrapFewShot, diminishing returns for 1 additional example

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **All criteria met**:
1. ✅ Reviewer dataset expanded 6 → 10 examples (avg quality 96.4%)
2. ✅ Coder dataset expanded 6 → 10 examples (avg quality 96.2%)
3. ✅ All examples use standardized `task_description`, `objective` format
4. ✅ Integration tests passing (7/7 - 100%)
5. ✅ Prompt engineering principles applied (≥3 per example)
6. ✅ DSPy best practices incorporated (corrected guide)

---

## Conclusion

✅ **DAY 2 DATASET EXPANSION SUCCESSFUL**: Reviewer and Coder datasets expanded from 6 → 10 examples each, incorporating prompt engineering principles and DSPy best practices from corrected integration strategy. All integration tests passing (100%).

**Recommendation**: ✅ **PROCEED TO TRAINING** - All 4 P0 agents ready for BootstrapFewShot optimization (30 min total).

**Alternative**: If Week 21-22 timeline tight, consider **SKIP DSPy** per Day 1 recommendation (production hardening better ROI than 10-20% quality improvement).

**Generated**: 2025-10-10
**Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (Dataset expansion 100%)
**Next**: Train all 4 P0 agents OR skip DSPy (stakeholder decision)
