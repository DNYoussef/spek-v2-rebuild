## Training Script Details

**File**: `scripts/train_all_dspy_optimizers.py`
**Total LOC**: 634 lines

**Key Features**:
- Batch training of all optimizers sequentially
- Metric-driven quality evaluation
- Automatic model saving to `models/dspy/`
- Error handling with fallback
- Training summary report generation

**Fixed Issues**:
- ✅ Unicode encoding errors (Windows cp1252 compatibility)
- ✅ Model-agnostic design (no Gemini-specific code)
- ✅ Reduced training rounds (2 instead of 3) for cost savings

---

## Next Steps (Post-Training)

### Phase 1: Verify Training Results (30 min)
**Tasks**:
1. Check training script output for completion status
2. Verify all 22 models saved in `models/dspy/`
3. Review quality scores for each optimizer
4. Document any failures or issues

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All 22 optimizers trained successfully
- ✅ Quality scores ≥40% (baseline acceptable)
- ✅ All models saved as JSON files
- ✅ No critical training errors

---

### Phase 2: DSPy Middleware Integration (2-3 hours)
**File**: `src/dspy_optimizers/integration/dspy_middleware.py`

**Components**:
1. **DSPyMiddleware class**:
   - Load trained optimizers from `models/dspy/`
   - Cache loaded optimizers for performance
   - Apply optimization during agent delegation
   - Fallback to baseline if DSPy fails

2. **Latency Monitoring**:
   - Track DSPy optimization time (target: <250ms)
   - Log latency metrics to file
   - Alert if latency exceeds 300ms

3. **Feature Flag Support**:
   - Environment variable: `DSPY_ENABLED=true/false`
   - Agent-level config: `use_dspy: true` in metadata
   - Per-path override capability

**Integration Points**:
- `AgentBase.delegate_task()` - Add DSPy middleware layer
- `QueenAgent` - Use DSPy for Princess delegation
- `PrincessDevAgent`, `PrincessQualityAgent`, `PrincessCoordinationAgent` - Use DSPy for Drone delegation

---

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (1-2 hours)
**File**: `tests/integration/test_dspy_integration.py`

**Test Coverage** (10 tests):
1. Test Queen→Princess-Dev delegation with DSPy
2. Test Princess-Dev→Coder delegation with DSPy
3. Test Coder→Princess-Dev result aggregation with DSPy
4. Test Princess↔Princess coordination with DSPy
5. Test DSPy latency <250ms (p95)
6. Test DSPy fallback on error
7. Test feature flag toggle
8. Test optimizer caching
9. Test full workflow (Queen→Princess→Drone→Princess→Queen)
10. Test parallel delegation with DSPy

**Validation**:
- All tests must pass
- Latency <250ms for 95% of calls
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

---

### Phase 4: Princess↔Princess & Princess→Queen Training (2-3 hours)
**Remaining Paths** (9 optimizers):
- 6 Princess↔Princess cross-hive coordination paths
- 3 Princess→Queen escalation paths

**Tasks**:
1. Create training script for Princess↔Princess paths
2. Create training script for Princess→Queen paths
3. Train 9 additional optimizers
4. Verify quality scores

**Total After Phase 4**: 34 trained optimizers (100% coverage)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Training Failures
**Mitigation**: Error handling in training script, skip failed optimizers
**Contingency**: Retrain failed optimizers manually

### Risk 2: Low Quality Scores
**Mitigation**: Accept ≥40% baseline, iterate on datasets if needed
**Contingency**: Use baseline prompts for low-scoring paths

### Risk 3: Claude API Rate Limits
**Mitigation**: Sequential training with delays
**Contingency**: Switch to Gemini free tier if needed

### Risk 4: High Training Costs
**Mitigation**: Reduced to 2 rounds (from 3), monitoring spend
**Contingency**: Stop training if cost exceeds $150

## Conclusion

DSPy training is now running autonomously for 22 Princess↔Drone communication path optimizers. Once complete, we'll have 25/34 optimizers trained (74% coverage), with only 9 remaining paths (Princess↔Princess and Princess→Queen).

**Current Status**: 🔄 **TRAINING IN PROGRESS** (est. 2-8 hours)
**Next Action**: Monitor training completion, then proceed with DSPy middleware integration
