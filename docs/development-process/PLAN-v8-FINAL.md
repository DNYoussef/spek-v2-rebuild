## Executive Summary

### Strategic Vision: Research-Backed Production Timeline

This plan delivers a **production-ready AI agent platform with Atlantis UI** using evidence-based technical solutions validated through comprehensive research (RESEARCH-v7-ATLANTIS.md). Key innovations include:

**Research-Validated Technical Solutions**:
1. **3D Performance**: On-demand rendering + instanced meshes (60 FPS for 5K+ files)
2. **WebSocket Scaling**: Redis Pub/Sub adapter (200+ concurrent users, <50ms latency)
3. **Vectorization Speed**: Parallel processing + git hash caching (10x speedup: 60s → 6s)
4. **Playwright Reliability**: 30s timeout + exponential backoff (<10% false positives)
5. **Docker Security**: Resource limits + network isolation (zero security incidents)

**Timeline**: 26 weeks (realistic with 2-week buffer)
**Budget**: $270/month operational cost (Phase 1), $381/month (Phase 2 conditional)
**Team**: 10 developers (4 parallel teams)
**Target**: 70-75% SWE-Bench solve rate, <5% failure rate in Loop 1

### Critical Gates (Launch Blockers)

**Week 4 Gate** (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Redis Pub/Sub adapter deployed (WebSocket horizontal scaling)
- Parallel vectorization implemented (10x speedup with git hash caching)
- Docker sandbox configured (resource limits + network isolation)
- **Failure Impact**: Week 5+ blocks (WebSocket failures, vectorization timeouts, security risks)

**Week 7 Gate** (GO/NO-GO for Full 3D):
- 3D performance prototype tested (5K+ files at 60 FPS)
- Decision: Proceed with full 3D (Weeks 13-14) OR ship with 2D fallback only
- **Failure Impact**: Defer 3D to Phase 2, ship with 2D visualizations (acceptable)

**Week 23 Gate** (Production Readiness):
- Load testing passed (200 users, 10K files, network instability simulation)
- All P0/P1 risks mitigated (zero critical failures)
- **Failure Impact**: NO-GO for production launch

### Timeline Risk Mitigation

**Aggressive vs Realistic**:
```
v7-DRAFT Timeline:  24 weeks (aggressive, 56% probability of delay)
v8-FINAL Timeline:  26 weeks (realistic, 82% on-time delivery)

Buffer Allocation:
- Week 14.5: 1-week buffer (after 3D visualizations)
- Week 22.5: 1-week buffer (after DSPy optimization)
- Contingency: 2 weeks total (8% timeline padding)
```

**Critical Path** (dependencies):
```
Week 4 (Core Infrastructure) → BLOCKS → Week 5-24 (all subsequent work)
   ├─ Redis adapter (WebSocket scaling)
   ├─ Parallel vectorization (UX critical)
   └─ Docker sandbox (security critical)

Week 7 (3D Performance Gate) → DETERMINES → Week 13-14 (3D implementation)
   ├─ 60 FPS achieved: Proceed with full 3D
   └─ <60 FPS: Ship with 2D fallback, defer 3D to Phase 2
```

## WEEK 4: CRITICAL GATE - Core Infrastructure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Overview

**CRITICAL**: Week 4 is the most important week of the entire 26-week timeline. ALL three critical infrastructure components MUST be deployed by Week 4 Friday or subsequent weeks will block.

**Critical Components**:
1. **Redis Pub/Sub Adapter** (WebSocket horizontal scaling)
2. **Parallel Vectorization** (10x speedup with git hash caching)
3. **Docker Sandbox** (resource limits + network isolation)

**Failure Impact**:
- Redis adapter missing → Week 6+ WebSocket failures (100+ users)
- Parallel vectorization missing → Week 6+ user abandonment (15-minute waits)
- Docker sandbox missing → Week 9+ security incidents (production testing blocked)

---

### Week 4 MONDAY: Redis Pub/Sub Adapter (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

**Team Assignment**: Team D (2 developers)

**Objective**: Deploy Redis Pub/Sub adapter for Socket.io horizontal scaling (200+ concurrent users)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Morning (4 hours)**: Redis infrastructure setup
  - Provision Redis instance (Upstash, 2GB)
  - Configure Redis connection pooling
  - Test Redis connectivity (pub/sub channels)
  - Setup monitoring (connection count, latency)

- [ ] **Afternoon (4 hours)**: Socket.io Redis adapter integration
  ```typescript
  // src/server/websocket/SocketServer.ts
  import { Server } from 'socket.io';
  import { createAdapter } from '@socket.io/redis-adapter';
  import { createClient } from 'redis';

  export async function setupWebSocketServer(httpServer: any) {
    const io = new Server(httpServer, {
      cors: { origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL }
    });

    // CRITICAL: Redis adapter for horizontal scaling
    const pubClient = createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL });
    const subClient = pubClient.duplicate();

    await pubClient.connect();
    await subClient.connect();

    io.adapter(createAdapter(pubClient, subClient));

    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      console.log('Client connected:', socket.id);

      socket.on('join-project', (projectId: string) => {
        socket.join(`project:${projectId}`);
      });

      socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('Client disconnected:', socket.id);
      });
    });

    return io;
  }
  ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Redis adapter deployed and functional
- [ ] WebSocket events broadcast across multiple servers (test with 2 server instances)
- [ ] Latency <50ms (message delivery, p95)
- [ ] Zero connection failures (100 concurrent test users)

**Tests**:
- [ ] Integration test: 2 Socket.io servers + Redis adapter
- [ ] Load test: 100 concurrent connections (simulate real traffic)
- [ ] Failover test: Kill 1 server, verify other server handles connections

**Deliverable**: Production-ready Redis adapter (horizontal scaling enabled)

### Week 4 TUESDAY: Parallel Vectorization (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

**Team Assignment**: Team A (3 developers)

**Objective**: Implement parallel vectorization with git hash caching (10x speedup: 60s → 6s)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Morning (4 hours)**: Parallel AST parsing + embedding
  ```typescript
  // src/services/vectorization/ParallelVectorizer.ts
  import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from 'langchain/embeddings/openai';
  import pLimit from 'p-limit';

  export async function parallelVectorize(files: string[]): Promise<Vector[]> {
    const limit = pLimit(10); // 10 parallel tasks

    // CRITICAL: Parallel processing (10x speedup)
    const vectors = await Promise.all(
      files.map(file => limit(async () => {
        const content = await fs.readFile(file, 'utf-8');
        const chunks = await chunkFile(content, 1000); // 1000 token chunks

        const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
          modelName: 'text-embedding-3-small',
          batchSize: 64 // CRITICAL: Batch size for OpenAI API
        });

        return await embeddings.embedDocuments(chunks);
      }))
    );

    return vectors.flat();
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Afternoon (4 hours)**: Git hash caching
  ```typescript

    projectId: string,
    projectPath: string
  ): Promise<VectorizationResult> {
    const redis = createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL });
    await redis.connect();

    // CRITICAL: Git commit hash fingerprint
    const currentFingerprint = await getGitCommitHash(projectPath);
    const cachedFingerprint = await redis.get(`project:${projectId}:fingerprint`);

    // Cache hit: Instant retrieval (0s)
    if (cachedFingerprint === currentFingerprint) {
      const cachedVectors = await redis.get(`project:${projectId}:vectors`);
      return JSON.parse(cachedVectors);
    }

    // Detect changed files (git diff)
    const changedFiles = await detectChangedFiles(projectPath, cachedFingerprint);

    // CRITICAL: Only vectorize changed files (10x speedup)
    const vectors = await parallelVectorize(changedFiles);

    // Update cache (30-day TTL)
    await redis.set(`project:${projectId}:fingerprint`, currentFingerprint, { EX: 2592000 });
    await redis.set(`project:${projectId}:vectors`, JSON.stringify(vectors), { EX: 2592000 });

    await redis.disconnect();

    return {
      totalFiles: changedFiles.length,
      totalVectors: vectors.length,
      cached: false,
      timeMs: Date.now() - startTime
    };
  }

  async function getGitCommitHash(projectPath: string): Promise<string> {
    const { stdout } = await execAsync('git rev-parse HEAD', { cwd: projectPath });
    return stdout.trim();
  }

  async function detectChangedFiles(
    projectPath: string,
    fromCommit: string
  ): Promise<string[]> {
    const { stdout } = await execAsync(`git diff --name-only ${fromCommit} HEAD`, {
      cwd: projectPath
    });
    return stdout.trim().split('\n').filter(f => f.endsWith('.ts') || f.endsWith('.tsx'));
  }
  ```

  export async function executeSandbox(
    code: string,
    language: 'node' | 'python'
  ): Promise<SandboxResult> {
    const docker = new Docker();

    const image = language === 'node' ? 'node:18-alpine' : 'python:3.11-alpine';

    const container = await docker.createContainer({
      Image: image,
      Cmd: ['sh', '-c', code],
      WorkingDir: '/app',

      HostConfig: {
        // CRITICAL: Resource limits (prevent DoS attacks)
        Memory: 512 * 1024 * 1024,        // 512MB RAM
        MemorySwap: 512 * 1024 * 1024,    // No swap
        CpuShares: 512,                    // 50% CPU priority
        CpuQuota: 50000,                   // 50% CPU time
        CpuPeriod: 100000,

        // CRITICAL: Network isolation (no external access)
        NetworkMode: 'none',

        // CRITICAL: Filesystem isolation
        ReadonlyRootfs: true,              // Read-only root
        Tmpfs: { '/tmp': 'rw,noexec,nosuid,size=100m' },  // Writable /tmp

        // CRITICAL: Security options
        SecurityOpt: ['no-new-privileges'], // Prevent privilege escalation
        CapDrop: ['ALL'],                   // Drop all capabilities
        CapAdd: [],                         // Add none back
      },

      User: 'node',  // CRITICAL: Run as non-root user
    });

    // CRITICAL: Timeout enforcement (30s max)
    const timeout = setTimeout(async () => {
      await container.kill();
      throw new Error('Sandbox timeout (30s exceeded)');
    }, 30000);

    await container.start();
    const result = await container.wait();
    clearTimeout(timeout);

    // Cleanup (always remove container)
    await container.remove({ force: true });

    return {
      exitCode: result.StatusCode,
      stdout: await container.logs({ stdout: true }),
      stderr: await container.logs({ stderr: true }),
      timeMs: Date.now() - startTime
    };
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Afternoon (4 hours)**: Security validation testing
  - Test malicious code execution (should fail safely)

## WEEK 7: 3D PERFORMANCE GATE (GO/NO-GO Decision)

### Overview

**CRITICAL**: Week 7 is the GO/NO-GO gate for full 3D visualizations (Weeks 13-14). A 3D performance prototype must be tested with 5K+ file projects at 60 FPS. If performance is poor, ship with 2D fallback only (acceptable compromise).

**Gate Decision**:
- **GO**: 60 FPS achieved with 5K+ files → Proceed with full 3D (Weeks 13-14)
- **NO-GO**: <60 FPS with 5K+ files → Ship with 2D fallback, defer 3D to Phase 2

---

### Week 7 WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY: 3D Performance Prototype (3 days)

**Team Assignment**: Team B (3 developers)

**Objective**: Build minimal 3D prototype and test with large projects (5K+ files)

  'use client';

  import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
  import { OrbitControls, Instances, Instance } from '@react-three/drei';

  export function Loop2VillagePrototype({ tasks }: { tasks: Task[] }) {
    return (
      <Canvas
        frameloop="demand"  // CRITICAL: On-demand rendering
        gl={{
          powerPreference: "high-performance",
          alpha: false,
          antialias: false,
          stencil: false,
          depth: true
        }}
        camera={{ position: [0, 50, 50], fov: 60 }}
        performance={{ min: 0.5 }}  // Adaptive performance
      >
        <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
        <directionalLight position={[10, 10, 5]} />

        {/* CRITICAL: Instanced rendering (100K+ objects in single draw call) */}
        <Instances limit={tasks.length}>
          <sphereGeometry args={[0.5, 8, 8]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color="yellow" />

          {tasks.map((task) => (
            <Instance
              key={task.id}
              position={task.position}
              scale={task.status === 'completed' ? 0.8 : 1.0}
              color={
                task.status === 'pending' ? 'gray' :
                task.status === 'in_progress' ? 'yellow' : 'green'
              }
            />
          ))}
        </Instances>

        <OrbitControls enableDamping dampingFactor={0.05} />
      </Canvas>
    );
  }
  ```

    maxRetries: number = 3
  ): Promise<Buffer> {
    const delays = [5000, 10000, 30000]; // Exponential backoff

    for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
      try {
        await page.goto(url, { timeout: delays[attempt] });

        // CRITICAL: Wait for WebGL initialization (if 3D implemented)

        }

        // Wait for stable state
        await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
        await page.waitForTimeout(500); // Buffer for animations

        // CRITICAL: Mask dynamic content
        await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(screenshotName, {
          maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01,  // 1% tolerance
          threshold: 0.2,            // Color similarity
          animations: 'disabled',
          mask: [
            page.locator('[data-testid="timestamp"]'),
            page.locator('[data-testid="user-avatar"]'),
            page.locator('.dynamic-content')

        });

        return await page.screenshot({ fullPage: true });
      } catch (error) {
        if (attempt === maxRetries - 1) {
          // CRITICAL: Manual approval fallback
          await notifyUser(`Screenshot failed for ${url}. Approve manually?`);
          throw error;
        }
        console.log(`Retry ${attempt + 1}/${maxRetries} for ${url}`);

## Critical Path Analysis

### Week 4 → Week 5+ Dependencies

**Critical Components** (Week 4):
1. Redis Pub/Sub adapter
2. Parallel vectorization
3. Docker sandbox

**Blocked by Week 4 Failure**:
```
Week 5-6 (Atlantis UI Foundation):
  - WebSocket real-time updates (blocked if Redis adapter missing)
  - Project selector (blocked if vectorization missing)

Week 7-8 (Loop 1 Implementation):
  - Agent thoughts streaming (blocked if Redis adapter missing)
  - Research artifact indexing (blocked if vectorization missing)

Week 9-10 (Loop 2 Execution):
  - Task execution pipeline (blocked if Docker sandbox missing)
  - 3-Stage audit system (blocked if Docker sandbox missing)

Week 23-24 (Production Validation):
  - Load testing (blocked if any Week 4 component missing)
```

**Impact**: Week 4 failure delays entire project by 1-2 weeks minimum

---

### Week 7 → Week 13-14 Dependencies

**Gate Decision** (Week 7):
- GO: 60 FPS with 5K+ files → Full 3D (Weeks 13-14)
- NO-GO: <60 FPS → 2D fallback, skip Weeks 13-14 3D work

**Blocked by Week 7 NO-GO**:
```
Week 13-14 (3D Visualizations):
  - Loop 1 orbital ring (3D)
  - Loop 2 execution village (3D)
  - Loop 3 concentric circles (3D)

Week 15-16 (UI Validation):
  - 3D screenshot testing (if 3D implemented)
  - WebGL timeout handling (if 3D implemented)
```

**Impact**: Week 7 NO-GO acceptable (2D fallback functional, defer 3D to Phase 2)

---

### Week 23 → Production Launch Dependencies

**Gate Decision** (Week 23):
- PASS: All load tests passed → GO for production
- FAIL: Any load test failed → NO-GO, fix issues, re-test

**Blocked by Week 23 FAIL**:
```
Week 25-26 (Production Launch):
  - Stakeholder approval (blocked)
  - Production deployment (blocked)
  - User onboarding (blocked)
```

**Impact**: Week 23 FAIL delays launch by 1-2 weeks (critical issues must be fixed)
