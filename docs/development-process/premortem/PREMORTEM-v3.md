# SPEK Platform v2 - Pre-Mortem Analysis v3

**Version**: 3.0
**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Active - Iteration 3 of 4
**Project**: C:\Users\17175\Desktop\spek-v2-rebuild

**Changes from v2**: Final validation before Iteration 4 - analyzes NEW risks that v3 simplifications may have missed or introduced

---

## Executive Summary

**Scenario**: It is December 2025. The SPEK v2 rebuild shipped with PLAN-v3/SPEC-v3 simplifications, but several unexpected challenges emerged during implementation. The system works, but there were costly surprises that could have been avoided with better pre-mortem analysis.

This pre-mortem v3 identifies **TOP 5-7 REMAINING risks** that could still derail the project despite v3's aggressive simplification strategy. Unlike v2, which increased total risk by 43%, v3 successfully reduced risk to 3,182. However, critical gaps remain.

**Critical Insight**: V3's simplifications solved the complexity cascade but introduced **over-simplification risks**. The lightweight internal protocol works beautifully for 22 agents but has zero extensibility for future growth. The facade pattern for SPEC KIT prevents conflicts but creates governance confusion about "who decides what."

**Risk Landscape Evolution**:
- v1 Top Risk: FSM Over-Engineering (684) → **MITIGATED** ✓
- v2 Top Risk: GitHub SPEC KIT Integration (810) → **MITIGATED** ✓ (facade pattern)
- v3 Top Risk: Lightweight Protocol Extensibility Gap (504) → **NEW** ⚠️

## Comparison: v2 vs v3 Risk Landscape

### v2 Pre-Mortem (Complexity Cascade Risks)
| Rank | Failure Scenario | Risk Score | Status in v3 |
|-----:|------------------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | GitHub SPEC KIT Integration | 810 | **MITIGATED** (Facade pattern) |
| 2 | DSPy Optimization Cost Explosion | 756 | **MITIGATED** (Selective: 4 agents) |
| 3 | Phased Rollout Integration Collapse | 720 | **MITIGATED** (AgentContract first) |
| 4 | Context DNA Storage Explosion | 672 | **MITIGATED** (30-day retention) |
| 5 | gVisor Sandbox Bottleneck | 630 | **MITIGATED** (20s target) |
| 6 | A2A Protocol Complexity | 594 | **MITIGATED** (Lightweight protocol) |

**v2 Total Risk Score**: 5,667

### v3 Pre-Mortem (NEW Risks from Simplifications)
| Rank | NEW Failure Scenario | Risk Score | Root Cause |
|-----:|----------------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Lightweight Protocol Extensibility Gap | 504 | Too simple for future 63+ agent expansion |
| 2 | Facade Pattern Governance Confusion | 462 | Unclear decision boundaries (values vs enforcement) |
| 3 | Selective DSPy Under-Optimization | 420 | Only 4 agents optimized, others remain poor performers |
| 4 | 20s Sandbox Still Too Slow | 384 | Incremental tests fail, layered images rebuild frequently |
| 5 | AgentContract Interface Rigidity | 336 | Optional methods create implementation inconsistency |
| 6 | Context DNA Retention Too Aggressive | 294 | 30-day policy deletes valuable learning data prematurely |
| 7 | Parallel Development Coordination Overhead | 252 | 3 teams developing Phase 2A/B/C concurrently create merge conflicts |

**v3 Total Risk Score**: 2,652 (vs target 3,400)
**Risk Reduction from v2**: 53% reduction (5,667 → 2,652)

## Top 7 REMAINING Risks (Ranked by Risk Score)

---

### RISK #1: Lightweight Protocol Extensibility Gap

**Risk Score**: 504 (70% probability x 2.4 impact x 10)
**Priority**: P1 - Critical
**Category**: Architecture limitations
**NEW**: V3 simplification trades extensibility for simplicity

#### What Could Go Wrong?

The lightweight internal protocol works perfectly for 22 agents in Phase 1-2. However, SPEK v2's long-term roadmap includes 85+ agents (currently only 22 implemented). When Phase 3 begins adding the remaining 63 agents:

1. **No Task Lifecycle Management**: Simple direct function calls can't track multi-hour tasks
2. **No Agent Discovery**: New agents can't register themselves dynamically
3. **No Load Balancing**: Protocol assigns tasks to specific agent IDs, not capabilities
4. **No Health Checks**: No way to detect if an agent has crashed
5. **No Retry Logic**: Single point of failure if execute() throws

**Example Failure Scenario**:

```typescript
// Week 20: Adding 10 new specialized agents
const newAgents = [
  new SecurityAuditAgent(),
  new PerformanceAnalyzerAgent(),
  new DocumentationAgent(),
  // ... 7 more agents
];

// Problem: Lightweight protocol assumes agents registered at startup
// No dynamic registration mechanism
protocol.registerAgent(securityAudit);  // Manual registration required

// Problem: No health monitoring
// If securityAudit crashes, protocol still routes tasks to it
const result = await protocol.assignTask("security-audit", task);
// Result: Hangs forever waiting for crashed agent
```

**Timeline Impact**:
- Week 20: Begin Phase 3 (63 additional agents)
- Week 21: Discover protocol limitations
- Week 22-24: **Emergency rewrite** to add task lifecycle, discovery, health checks
- Week 25-26: Re-test all 22 existing agents with new protocol
- **Total Delay**: 6+ weeks

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Over-Simplification**: Removed A2A protocol's valuable features (task lifecycle, discovery)
2. **Short-Term Focus**: Designed for 22 agents, not 85+ agents
3. **No Extensibility Strategy**: No hooks for adding features later
4. **False Dichotomy**: Assumed choice was "full A2A" or "no A2A" (hybrid possible)

#### Early Warning Signs

- Agents taking >5 minutes to complete tasks with no progress updates
- Manual registration code for every new agent
- Duplicate "find agent by capability" logic scattered across codebase
- Team discussions about "how do we detect crashed agents?"
- GitHub issues requesting task status tracking

#### How to Prevent It

**Option 1: Hybrid Protocol (Recommended)**

```typescript
// src/coordination/HybridAgentProtocol.ts
export class HybridAgentProtocol {
  private agents: Map<string, Agent> = new Map();
  private taskStates: Map<string, TaskState> = new Map();  // Lightweight tracking

  registerAgent(agent: Agent): void {
    this.agents.set(agent.agentId, agent);

    // Optional: Agent can provide health check endpoint
    if (agent.getHealthCheck) {
      this.startHealthMonitoring(agent);
    }
  }

  async assignTask(agentId: string, task: Task): Promise<Result> {
    const agent = this.agents.get(agentId);
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error(`Agent not found: ${agentId}`);
    }

    // Lightweight task tracking (not full A2A)
    const taskId = this.trackTaskStart(agentId, task);

    try {
      // Direct function call (keep simple)
      const result = await agent.execute(task);

      // Mark complete
      this.trackTaskComplete(taskId, result);

      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      // Mark failed
      this.trackTaskFailed(taskId, error);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  // Lightweight task tracking (no database)
  private trackTaskStart(agentId: string, task: Task): string {
    const taskId = uuid.v4();
    this.taskStates.set(taskId, {
      status: "in_progress",
      agentId,
      startTime: Date.now()
    });

    // Auto-cleanup after 1 hour
    setTimeout(() => this.taskStates.delete(taskId), 3600000);

    return taskId;
  }

  // Health monitoring (optional, only if agent provides it)
  private startHealthMonitoring(agent: Agent): void {
    setInterval(async () => {
      try {
        const healthy = await agent.getHealthCheck();
        if (!healthy) {
          console.warn(`Agent ${agent.agentId} health check failed`);
          this.agents.delete(agent.agentId);  // Remove unhealthy agent
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Health check error for ${agent.agentId}:`, error);
      }
    }, 60000);  // Check every minute
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Extensibility Hooks**

```typescript
// Allow custom middleware
export class ExtensibleProtocol extends LightweightAgentProtocol {
  private middleware: Middleware[] = [];

  use(middleware: Middleware): void {
    this.middleware.push(middleware);
  }

  async assignTask(agentId: string, task: Task): Promise<Result> {
    // Run pre-execution middleware
    for (const mw of this.middleware) {
      task = await mw.beforeExecute(task);
    }

    // Execute
    const result = await super.assignTask(agentId, task);

    // Run post-execution middleware
    for (const mw of this.middleware) {
      await mw.afterExecute(task, result);
    }

    return result;
  }
}

// Usage: Add task tracking via middleware
protocol.use(new TaskTrackingMiddleware());
protocol.use(new HealthCheckMiddleware());
protocol.use(new RetryMiddleware({ maxRetries: 3 }));
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Add Lightweight Task Tracking**: In-memory task states (no database overhead)
2. **Optional Health Checks**: Agents can provide getHealthCheck() method
3. **Middleware Pattern**: Allow extensibility without core complexity
4. **Document Trade-offs**: Clear guidance on when to add A2A for external integrations
5. **Incremental Enhancement**: Add features only when needed (not upfront)

#### Success Metrics

- Protocol supports 85+ agents without rewrite
- Task lifecycle tracking overhead: <10ms per task
- Health checks optional (not required)
- Extension via middleware (not core changes)
- Zero breaking changes for existing 22 agents

---

### RISK #2: Facade Pattern Governance Confusion

**Risk Score**: 462 (66% probability x 2.3 impact x 10)
**Priority**: P1 - Critical
**Category**: Governance and decision-making
**NEW**: V3 facade pattern prevents conflicts but creates ambiguity

#### What Could Go Wrong?

PLAN-v3 solved SPEC KIT integration with facade pattern: Constitution.md provides VALUES, SPEK CLAUDE.md provides ENFORCEMENT. However, the boundary between "values" and "enforcement" is inherently ambiguous:

**Example Governance Conflicts**:

1. **Scenario**: Developer wants to use simple function instead of FSM
   - **Constitution says**: "Simplicity over cleverness"
   - **SPEK says**: "FSM-first for complex workflows (>=3 criteria)"
   - **Conflict**: Is this workflow "complex"? Who decides?

2. **Scenario**: Agent performance is poor but baseline >70%
   - **Constitution says**: "Integration over isolation" (optimize for team performance)
   - **SPEK says**: "Skip agents with baseline >=70%" (selective optimization)
   - **Conflict**: Should we optimize to help team, or follow SPEK rules?

3. **Scenario**: Test coverage at 78% but feature complete
   - **Constitution says**: "Pragmatism over dogma"
   - **SPEK says**: ">=80% test coverage required"
   - **Conflict**: Ship now (pragmatic) or wait for 2% more coverage?

**Decision Paralysis Example**:

```typescript
// Agent receives contradictory guidance
class CoderAgent {
  async implementFeature(spec: Spec): Promise<Code> {
    // Question 1: Use FSM or simple function?
    // Constitution: "Simplicity over cleverness" → Simple function
    // SPEK: "FSM if >=3 criteria" → Need to check criteria
    //
    // Decision time: 30 minutes debating in code review

    // Question 2: How many assertions?
    // Constitution: "Observability over opacity" → Add assertions for debugging
    // SPEK: ">=2 assertions (NASA POT10)" → Minimum 2
    //
    // But how many is "observable enough"? 2? 5? 10?
    //
    // Decision time: 15 minutes debating

    // Question 3: Test coverage?
    // Constitution: "Pragmatism over dogma" → 75% might be enough
    // SPEK: ">=80% coverage" → Must reach 80%
    //
    // Which takes precedence?
    //
    // Decision time: 20 minutes escalating to team lead
  }
}
```

**Timeline Impact**:
- Week 5-8: Implement 13 specialized agents
- Each agent: 6-8 governance decisions
- Average decision time: 20 minutes (with facade ambiguity)
- Total waste: 13 agents × 7 decisions × 20 min = **30+ hours** (4 days)

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Unclear Boundary**: "Values" vs "Enforcement" is philosophically unclear
2. **Competing Principles**: Constitution values can contradict SPEK rules
3. **No Precedence Rules**: Document says "SPEK overrides" but doesn't define scope
4. **Human Judgment Required**: Every conflict requires human decision, not automated
5. **No Examples**: Facade pattern documentation lacks worked examples

#### Early Warning Signs

- PRs with 10+ comments debating which system to follow
- Team meetings dominated by "Constitution says X but SPEK says Y" discussions
- Agents asking "which rule applies here?" multiple times per day
- Documentation PRs trying to clarify boundary between values/enforcement
- Governance decisions requiring escalation to project lead

#### How to Prevent It

**Option 1: Decision Matrix with Examples (Recommended)**

```markdown
# .specify/memory/governance-decision-matrix.md

## When Constitution Values Override SPEK Rules

| Scenario | Constitution Guidance | SPEK Rule | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Simple workflow (2 states) | "Simplicity over cleverness" | "FSM if >=3 criteria" | **Constitution wins** | Only 2 states, FSM is overkill |
| Complex workflow (5 states) | "Simplicity over cleverness" | "FSM if >=3 criteria" | **SPEK wins** | Meets >=3 criteria, FSM justified |
| Test coverage 78% | "Pragmatism" | ">=80% coverage" | **SPEK wins** | Quality gates are non-negotiable |
| Agent baseline 72% | "Integration over isolation" | "Skip optimization >=70%" | **SPEK wins** | Cost control is critical |
| Assertion count | "Observability" | ">=2 assertions (NASA)" | **SPEK wins** | NASA compliance is minimum |

## Decision Rules

1. **Quality Gates**: SPEK rules are non-negotiable (test coverage, NASA compliance)
2. **Cost Control**: SPEK rules override Constitution (DSPy optimization budget)
3. **Architecture Decisions**: Use FSM decision matrix (objective criteria, not judgment)
4. **Pragmatism**: Constitution wins ONLY when SPEK rule creates unnecessary overhead
```

**Option 2: Automated Decision Tool**

```typescript
// src/governance/GovernanceDecisionEngine.ts
export class GovernanceDecisionEngine {
  decideArchitecture(feature: FeatureSpec): ArchitectureDecision {
    // Objective FSM decision matrix
    const criteria = this.evaluateFSMCriteria(feature);

    if (criteria.meetsThreshold) {
      return {
        decision: "FSM",
        reason: "Meets >=3 FSM criteria (objective)",
        precedence: "SPEK FSM Decision Matrix"
      };
    } else {
      return {
        decision: "Simple Function",
        reason: "Only 2 criteria met, Constitution simplicity applies",
        precedence: "Constitution (simplicity over cleverness)"
      };
    }
  }

  evaluateFSMCriteria(feature: FeatureSpec): FSMCriteria {
    return {
      multipleStates: feature.stateCount >= 3,
      complexTransitions: feature.transitionCount >= 5,
      errorRecovery: feature.requiresRollback,
      auditTrail: feature.requiresCompliance,
      meetsThreshold: [
        feature.stateCount >= 3,
        feature.transitionCount >= 5,
        feature.requiresRollback,
        feature.requiresCompliance
      ].filter(Boolean).length >= 3
    };
  }

  decideTestCoverage(currentCoverage: number, feature: string): Decision {
    // Quality gates are non-negotiable
    if (currentCoverage < 80) {
      return {
        decision: "BLOCK",
        reason: "Test coverage below 80% (SPEK quality gate)",
        precedence: "SPEK (quality gates override pragmatism)"
      };
    }

    return {
      decision: "APPROVE",
      reason: "Test coverage meets threshold",
      precedence: "SPEK"
    };
  }
}
```

**Option 3: Worked Examples in Documentation**

```markdown
# .claude/commands/governance-examples.md

## Example 1: User Authentication Flow

**Scenario**: Implement user login feature

**Constitution Guidance**: "Simplicity over cleverness"
**SPEK FSM Check**:
- States: IDLE, AUTHENTICATING, AUTHENTICATED, FAILED (4 states) ✓
- Transitions: LOGIN, SUCCESS, FAILURE, LOGOUT, TIMEOUT (5 transitions) ✓
- Error recovery: Yes (FAILED state with retry) ✓
- Audit trail: Yes (security compliance) ✓

**Decision**: USE FSM
**Rationale**: Meets 4/4 FSM criteria. Despite Constitution's simplicity value, FSM is objectively justified by decision matrix.

## Example 2: String Formatting Utility

**Scenario**: Format user name for display

**Constitution Guidance**: "Simplicity over cleverness"
**SPEK FSM Check**:
- States: N/A (no state management) ✗
- Transitions: N/A ✗
- Error recovery: No ✗
- Audit trail: No ✗

**Decision**: USE SIMPLE FUNCTION
**Rationale**: Meets 0/4 FSM criteria. Constitution's simplicity value applies. No FSM needed.

```function formatName(first: string, last: string): string {
  assert(first.length > 0, "First name cannot be empty");
  assert(last.length > 0, "Last name cannot be empty");
  return `${first} ${last}`;
}
```
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Create Decision Matrix**: Document clear examples of when each system wins
2. **Automate Decisions**: Build GovernanceDecisionEngine for objective criteria
3. **Update Documentation**: Add 10-15 worked examples covering common conflicts
4. **Team Training**: 2-hour workshop on governance decision process
5. **Weekly Review**: Review any governance escalations, update decision matrix

#### Success Metrics

- Governance decisions: <5 minutes average (vs 20 minutes during failure)
- Escalations to team lead: <2 per week (vs 10+ during failure)
- PR comments debating governance: <3 per PR (vs 10+ during failure)
- Team satisfaction: >=8/10 (clear rules)
- Documentation clarity: >=9/10 (no contradictions)

### RISK #3: Selective DSPy Under-Optimization

**Risk Score**: 420 (60% probability x 2.3 impact x 10)
**Priority**: P2 - Important
**Category**: Performance degradation
**NEW**: V3 optimizes only 4 agents, leaving 18 agents with poor baselines

#### What Could Go Wrong?

PLAN-v3 reduces DSPy optimization from 22 agents (v2) to 4 agents (v3): queen, princess-dev, princess-quality, coder. This saves $424/month but leaves 18 agents unoptimized:

**Unoptimized Agents** (baseline <70%):
- researcher: 0.66 baseline (P1 priority)
- tester: 0.69 baseline (P1 priority)
- princess-coordination: 0.58 baseline (P0 priority, but excluded)
- 13 specialized agents: Unknown baselines (assume 0.50-0.65)

**Performance Impact Example**:

```
Week 10: Deploy complete system (22 agents)

Performance Testing:
- queen: 0.78 (optimized, +23% from 0.55 baseline) ✓
- princess-dev: 0.80 (optimized, +18% from 0.62 baseline) ✓
- princess-quality: 0.76 (optimized, +18% from 0.58 baseline) ✓
- coder: 0.71 (optimized, +23% from 0.48 baseline) ✓

- researcher: 0.66 (not optimized, same as baseline) ✗
- tester: 0.69 (not optimized, same as baseline) ✗
- princess-coordination: 0.58 (not optimized, poor) ✗
- specialized agents: 0.50-0.65 (not optimized, poor) ✗

Overall System Performance: 0.65 (weighted average)
Target: 0.75

**GAP: System performance 10% below target**
```

**User Experience Impact**:
- Research tasks: 66% success rate (34% failures require retry)
- Testing tasks: 69% success rate (31% failures)
- Coordination tasks: 58% success rate (42% failures)
- Specialized tasks: 50-65% success rate (35-50% failures)

**Timeline Impact**:
- Week 11: Stakeholders report poor system reliability
- Week 12: Emergency decision to optimize remaining agents
- Week 13-14: Optimize 8 more agents (researcher, tester, coordination, 5 specialized)
- Week 15: Re-test system performance
- **Total Delay**: 4 weeks

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Arbitrary Cutoff**: Optimized P0 agents only, but princess-coordination (P0, 0.58 baseline) excluded
2. **Baseline Threshold Too High**: >=70% threshold excludes agents at 0.66-0.69 (close to threshold)
3. **No System-Level Metric**: Focused on per-agent cost, not overall system performance
4. **Unknown Specialized Baselines**: 13 specialized agents have no baseline measurements

#### Early Warning Signs

- System-level task success rate: <75%
- High retry rates for research and testing tasks
- User complaints about "inconsistent" agent performance
- Coordination failures between princess agents
- Team discussions about "should we optimize more agents?"

#### How to Prevent It

**Option 1: Expanded Selective Optimization (Recommended)**

```typescript
// Optimize 8 agents instead of 4 (still within budget)
const optimizationCandidates = [
  // P0 agents (all with baseline <70%)
  { agent: "queen", baseline: 0.55, priority: "P0", cost: "$0" },
  { agent: "princess-dev", baseline: 0.62, priority: "P0", cost: "$0" },
  { agent: "princess-quality", baseline: 0.58, priority: "P0", cost: "$0" },
  { agent: "princess-coordination", baseline: 0.58, priority: "P0", cost: "$0" },  // ADD THIS
  { agent: "coder", baseline: 0.48, priority: "P0", cost: "$0" },

  // P1 agents close to threshold
  { agent: "researcher", baseline: 0.66, priority: "P1", cost: "$0" },
  { agent: "tester", baseline: 0.69, priority: "P1", cost: "$0" },

  // Highest-impact specialized agent
  { agent: "security-manager", baseline: 0.52, priority: "P1", cost: "$0" }
];

// Total cost: 8 agents × 20 trials × 3K tokens × $0 (Gemini free) = $0
// Target system performance: 0.72 (vs 0.65 with 4 agents)
```

**Option 2: Baseline Measurement First**

```typescript
// Week 5: Measure ALL agent baselines before deciding
async function measureAllBaselines() {
  const agents = [
    "queen", "princess-dev", "princess-quality", "princess-coordination",
    "coder", "reviewer", "researcher", "planner", "tester",
    ...specializedAgents
  ];

  const baselines = await Promise.all(
    agents.map(async (agentId) => {
      const agent = getAgent(agentId);
      const testset = await loadTestset(agentId);
      const score = await evaluateAgent(agent, testset);

      return { agent: agentId, baseline: score };
    })
  );

  // Sort by baseline ascending
  baselines.sort((a, b) => a.baseline - b.baseline);

  console.log("Agent Baselines:");
  baselines.forEach(b => {
    console.log(`  ${b.agent}: ${(b.baseline * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
  });

  // Optimize bottom 8 agents
  const toOptimize = baselines.slice(0, 8);
  console.log(`Optimizing: ${toOptimize.map(a => a.agent).join(", ")}`);
}
```

**Option 3: System-Level Performance Target**

```yaml
# optimization-policy-v2.yaml
optimization_policy:
  target_system_performance: 0.75  # Weighted average across all agents

  agent_weights:
    queen: 0.15                    # 15% of system performance
    princess-dev: 0.10
    princess-quality: 0.10
    princess-coordination: 0.10
    coder: 0.12
    researcher: 0.08
    tester: 0.08
    reviewer: 0.05
    planner: 0.05
    specialized: 0.17              # 17% total (13 agents × 1.3% each)

  optimization_strategy:
    - Optimize agents with baseline <0.70 AND weight >0.08
    - Optimize agents with baseline <0.60 regardless of weight
    - Re-evaluate system performance after each optimization
    - Stop when system_performance >= 0.75 OR budget exhausted

  budget: $50/month
  free_tier_first: true  # Use Gemini Pro free tier
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Measure All Baselines First**: Week 5 - measure 22 agent baselines before deciding
2. **Expand to 8 Agents**: Optimize queen, 3 princesses, coder, researcher, tester, security-manager
3. **System-Level Target**: Track weighted average performance (target: 0.75)
4. **Iterative Optimization**: Optimize batch of 4, measure system perf, optimize 4 more if needed
5. **Free Tier Only**: Use Gemini Pro free tier ($0 cost)

#### Success Metrics

- System performance: >=0.75 (weighted average)
- Optimized agents: 8 (vs 4 in original plan)
- Monthly cost: $0 (vs $0 in original, but better coverage)
- Task success rate: >=75% (vs 65% during failure)
- User satisfaction: >=8/10 (reliable system)

### RISK #4: 20s Sandbox Still Too Slow

**Risk Score**: 384 (64% probability x 2.0 impact x 10)
**Priority**: P2 - Important
**Category**: Developer velocity
**NEW**: V3's 20s target is 3x better than v2's 60s, but still blocks development flow

#### What Could Go Wrong?

PLAN-v3 optimizes sandbox validation from 60s (v2) to 20s (v3) using:
- Layered Docker images (cache dependencies)
- Pre-warmed container pool
- Incremental testing (only affected tests)

However, 20s is still problematic:

**Developer Flow Disruption**:
```
Developer workflow WITHOUT sandbox:
  1. Write code (5 min)
  2. Run local tests (10s)
  3. Commit (5s)
  Total: 5:15 minutes

Developer workflow WITH 20s sandbox:
  1. Write code (5 min)
  2. Run local tests (10s)
  3. Trigger sandbox validation (20s)  ← BLOCKING
  4. Commit (5s)
  Total: 5:35 minutes

Context switch cost:
  - Developers check email/Slack during 20s wait
  - Re-loading mental context: 2-3 minutes
  Effective time: 5:35 + 2:30 = 8:05 minutes

Productivity loss: 50% slower (5:15 → 8:05)
```

**Swarm Coordination Impact**:
```
Swarm deploying 10 drones simultaneously:
  - All 10 complete tasks at same time
  - All 10 trigger sandbox validation
  - Pre-warmed pool: 3 containers

  Validation queue:
    Batch 1: 3 agents × 20s = 20s
    Batch 2: 3 agents × 20s = 20s
    Batch 3: 3 agents × 20s = 20s
    Batch 4: 1 agent × 20s = 20s

  Total swarm blocked for: 80 seconds

  Queen coordination timeout: 60 seconds
  **RESULT: Coordination timeout, swarm deployment fails**
```

**False Optimism from Incremental Tests**:
```
Incremental testing assumptions:
  - Only run tests affected by changed files
  - 80% of changes affect <5 test files
  - Time: 5-10s (vs 20s for full suite)

Reality:
  - Changed file: src/agents/CoderAgent.ts
  - Affected tests: tests/agents/CoderAgent.test.ts (1 file)
  - Run incremental: 5s ✓

  BUT:
  - CoderAgent changes break integration tests
  - Integration tests NOT run (not in affected set)
  - CI/CD full test suite catches failure
  - False sense of security

  **RESULT: 50% of incremental validations miss real failures**
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Human Context Switch**: 20s is long enough to break developer flow
2. **Concurrent Load**: Pre-warmed pool (3 containers) insufficient for 10 simultaneous drones
3. **Incremental Test Gaps**: Only affected tests miss integration failures
4. **Docker Layer Rebuilds**: Layered images still rebuild when package.json changes (weekly)

#### Early Warning Signs

- Developer complaints about "waiting for sandbox"
- Swarm coordination timeouts during high load
- CI/CD catching failures that sandbox missed
- Sandbox queue depth >3 frequently
- Team discussions about "can we skip sandbox for small changes?"

#### How to Prevent It

**Option 1: Async Sandbox with Commit-First (Recommended)**

```typescript
// Developer commits immediately, sandbox validates asynchronously
class AsyncSandboxValidator {
  async validateAsync(commit: Commit): Promise<void> {
    // Allow commit to proceed immediately
    console.log(`Commit ${commit.sha} accepted, validating asynchronously...`);

    // Validate in background
    const result = await this.runSandboxValidation(commit);

    if (result.status === "failed") {
      // Notify developer via GitHub comment
      await github.createComment({
        commit: commit.sha,
        message: `⚠️ Sandbox validation FAILED for ${commit.sha}:

${result.failures.map(f => `- ${f.message}`).join("\n")}

Please fix and push new commit.`
      });

      // Block PR merge (not commit)
      await github.updateCommitStatus({
        commit: commit.sha,
        state: "failure",
        context: "sandbox-validation"
      });
    } else {
      await github.updateCommitStatus({
        commit: commit.sha,
        state: "success",
        context: "sandbox-validation"
      });
    }
  }
}

// Developer workflow: No blocking wait
// 1. Write code (5 min)
// 2. Run local tests (10s)
// 3. Commit (5s) ← Immediate
// 4. Continue working (not blocked)
// 5. Notification arrives (20s later) if failure
```

**Option 2: Expand Pre-Warmed Pool**

```yaml
# docker-compose-sandbox.yml
services:
  sandbox-pool-1:
    image: spek-sandbox:latest
    runtime: runsc
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]

  sandbox-pool-2:
    image: spek-sandbox:latest
    runtime: runsc
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]

  sandbox-pool-3:
    image: spek-sandbox:latest
    runtime: runsc
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]

  # ADD 7 MORE for 10 concurrent drones
  sandbox-pool-4:
    image: spek-sandbox:latest
    runtime: runsc
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]

  # ... sandbox-pool-10

# Result: 10 concurrent validations, no queueing
# Cost: Higher memory usage (10 containers × 500MB = 5GB)
```

**Option 3: Smart Incremental with Full Fallback**

```typescript
// Run incremental first, then full if high-risk change
class SmartIncrementalTester {
  async runTests(changedFiles: string[]): Promise<TestResult> {
    // Detect high-risk changes
    const isHighRisk = this.detectHighRisk(changedFiles);

    if (isHighRisk) {
      console.log("High-risk change detected, running FULL test suite");
      return await this.runFullTests();  // 20s
    }

    // Run incremental for low-risk changes
    console.log("Low-risk change, running INCREMENTAL tests");
    const incrementalResult = await this.runIncrementalTests(changedFiles);  // 5-10s

    // If incremental fails, run full suite to confirm
    if (incrementalResult.status === "failed") {
      console.log("Incremental failed, confirming with FULL test suite");
      return await this.runFullTests();
    }

    return incrementalResult;
  }

  detectHighRisk(changedFiles: string[]): boolean {
    // High-risk patterns
    const highRiskPatterns = [
      /src\/types\//,           // Type changes affect everything
      /src\/coordination\//,    // Coordination logic is critical
      /src\/agents\/AgentContract/,  // Contract changes affect all agents
      /package\.json/,          // Dependency changes
      /tsconfig\.json/          // TypeScript config
    ];

    return changedFiles.some(file =>
      highRiskPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(file))
    );
  }
}
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Async Validation**: Commit immediately, validate in background
2. **Expand Pool to 10**: Support 10 concurrent drones
3. **Smart Incremental**: Full tests for high-risk changes only
4. **Notification System**: GitHub comments for async failures
5. **Block PR Merge, Not Commit**: Allow rapid iteration, block at PR stage

#### Success Metrics

- Developer velocity: <5% overhead (vs 50% during failure)
- Swarm coordination timeouts: 0 (vs frequent during failure)
- False negatives: <5% (incremental missing real failures)
- Sandbox queue depth: <=3 (vs >5 during failure)
- Developer satisfaction: >=8/10 (not blocked)

### RISK #5: AgentContract Interface Rigidity

**Risk Score**: 336 (56% probability x 2.0 impact x 10)
**Priority**: P2 - Important
**Category**: Implementation inconsistency
**NEW**: V3's optional methods create ambiguity and inconsistent implementations

#### What Could Go Wrong?

PLAN-v3's AgentContract has optional methods for state management:

```typescript
export interface AgentContract {
  // ... required methods ...

  // State management (optional, based on FSM decision matrix)
  getCurrentState?(): string;
  transition?(event: Event): Promise<TransitionResult>;
}
```

**Problem**: Optional methods lead to inconsistent implementations:

1. **Some agents implement, some don't** → Integration tests break
2. **No clear guidance** on when optional methods are required
3. **Type system allows calling optional methods** without checking existence

**Example Failure**:

```typescript
// Week 7: Princess agent tries to inspect drone state
class PrincessAgent {
  async monitorDrone(drone: AgentContract): Promise<DroneStatus> {
    // Assume drone has state management
    const state = drone.getCurrentState();  // ❌ Runtime error if not implemented

    if (state === "FAILED") {
      await this.restartDrone(drone);
    }

    return { droneId: drone.agentId, state };
  }
}

// CoderAgent (simple, no FSM)
class CoderAgent implements AgentContract {
  // Does NOT implement getCurrentState() or transition()
  // Runtime error when Princess calls getCurrentState()
}

// Queen orchestrator (complex, has FSM)
class QueenAgent implements AgentContract {
  // DOES implement getCurrentState() and transition()
  getCurrentState(): string {
    return this.currentState;
  }
}

// Result: Works for Queen, fails for Coder
```

**Timeline Impact**:
- Week 7: Integration testing discovers optional method inconsistencies
- Week 8: Emergency decision - make methods required or remove them
- Week 9-10: Refactor all 22 agents to match decision
- **Total Delay**: 3+ weeks

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Premature Optimization**: Made methods optional to support both FSM and non-FSM agents
2. **No Adapter Pattern**: Direct optional methods instead of adapter layer
3. **TypeScript Weakness**: Optional methods have no runtime checks
4. **FSM Decision Matrix Ambiguity**: Unclear when "optional" becomes "required"

#### Early Warning Signs

- Runtime errors calling optional methods
- Integration tests failing sporadically
- PRs with "add optional method stubs" changes
- Team discussions about "when do we need getCurrentState()?"
- Type errors like "Cannot invoke an expression whose type lacks a call signature"

#### How to Prevent It

**Option 1: Required Methods with No-Op Implementations (Recommended)**

```typescript
// Make ALL methods required, provide no-op defaults for non-FSM agents
export interface AgentContract {
  // ... other required methods ...

  // State management (required for all)
  getCurrentState(): string;
  transition(event: Event): Promise<TransitionResult>;
}

// Simple agents use no-op implementations
class CoderAgent implements AgentContract {
  getCurrentState(): string {
    return "IDLE";  // Always IDLE for stateless agents
  }

  async transition(event: Event): Promise<TransitionResult> {
    return { nextState: "IDLE" };  // No-op transition
  }
}

// Complex agents use real FSM
class QueenAgent implements AgentContract {
  private fsm: FSMachine;

  getCurrentState(): string {
    return this.fsm.getCurrentState();
  }

  async transition(event: Event): Promise<TransitionResult> {
    return await this.fsm.transition(event);
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Separate Interfaces**

```typescript
// Split AgentContract into base + optional extensions
export interface AgentContract {
  // Required methods only
  readonly agentId: string;
  readonly agentType: AgentType;
  execute(task: Task): Promise<Result>;
  // ... other required methods ...
}

// Optional extension for FSM agents
export interface StatefulAgent extends AgentContract {
  getCurrentState(): string;
  transition(event: Event): Promise<TransitionResult>;
}

// Type guard for checking FSM support
export function isStatefulAgent(agent: AgentContract): agent is StatefulAgent {
  return "getCurrentState" in agent && typeof agent.getCurrentState === "function";
}

// Usage: Safe optional method calls
class PrincessAgent {
  async monitorDrone(drone: AgentContract): Promise<DroneStatus> {
    if (isStatefulAgent(drone)) {
      const state = drone.getCurrentState();  // ✓ Safe, type-checked
      return { droneId: drone.agentId, state };
    } else {
      // Stateless agent, no monitoring
      return { droneId: drone.agentId, state: "STATELESS" };
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 3: Capability-Based Detection**

```typescript
export interface AgentContract {
  readonly capabilities: AgentCapability[];  // Required

  // Methods based on capabilities
  execute(task: Task): Promise<Result>;

  // State management (only if HAS_STATE capability)
  getCurrentState?(): string;
  transition?(event: Event): Promise<TransitionResult>;
}

export enum AgentCapability {
  CODE_GENERATION = "code_generation",
  HAS_STATE = "has_state",           // Declares FSM support
  HAS_HEALTH_CHECK = "has_health_check",
  SUPPORTS_RETRY = "supports_retry"
}

// CoderAgent declares no state
class CoderAgent implements AgentContract {
  readonly capabilities = [AgentCapability.CODE_GENERATION];  // No HAS_STATE

  // No getCurrentState() or transition()
}

// Queen declares state management
class QueenAgent implements AgentContract {
  readonly capabilities = [AgentCapability.HAS_STATE];

  getCurrentState(): string { ... }
  transition(event: Event) { ... }
}

// Usage: Check capability before calling optional methods
class PrincessAgent {
  async monitorDrone(drone: AgentContract): Promise<DroneStatus> {
    if (drone.capabilities.includes(AgentCapability.HAS_STATE)) {
      const state = drone.getCurrentState!();  // ✓ Safe (capability checked)
      return { droneId: drone.agentId, state };
    } else {
      return { droneId: drone.agentId, state: "STATELESS" };
    }
  }
}
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Required Methods with No-Ops**: Make all methods required, provide default implementations
2. **Clear Documentation**: When to use no-op vs real implementation
3. **ESLint Rule**: Enforce all AgentContract implementations have all methods
4. **Integration Tests**: Test cross-agent method calls (FSM ↔ non-FSM)
5. **Example Implementations**: Provide templates for both FSM and non-FSM agents

#### Success Metrics

- Runtime errors from optional methods: 0 (vs frequent during failure)
- Integration test failures: <5% (vs 30% during failure)
- Type safety: 100% (no unchecked optional method calls)
- Developer clarity: >=9/10 (clear when methods needed)
- Code consistency: >=95% (consistent implementations)

### RISK #6: Context DNA Retention Too Aggressive

**Risk Score**: 294 (49% probability x 2.0 impact x 10)
**Priority**: P3 - Nice to have
**Category**: Data loss
**NEW**: V3's 30-day retention deletes valuable learning data prematurely

#### What Could Go Wrong?

PLAN-v3 implements 30-day Context DNA retention to prevent storage explosion (v2 risk). However, 30 days may be too aggressive for:

1. **Long-Running Projects**: Development cycles >30 days lose early context
2. **Seasonal Patterns**: Need 60-90 day history to detect quarterly patterns
3. **A/B Testing**: Comparing agent performance requires >30 day baseline
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Bug investigations reference context >30 days old

**Example Failure**:

```
Week 15: Production incident - Queen agent making poor task assignments

Investigation:
  1. Check recent Context DNA (last 14 days): Shows good assignments
  2. Need to compare with baseline (Week 1-2 when assignments were poor)
  3. Week 1-2 Context DNA: DELETED (>30 days old)

Result: Cannot perform root cause analysis, no baseline for comparison
```

**Data Loss Scenarios**:
```
Scenario 1: Long-running feature (45 days)
  - Feature started Week 1
  - Development ongoing Weeks 1-45
  - Week 1-15 Context DNA: DELETED
  - Cannot trace early design decisions

Scenario 2: Quarterly performance review (90 days)
  - Need to compare Q1 vs Q2 agent performance
  - Q1 data (90 days old): DELETED
  - Cannot perform quarterly analysis

Scenario 3: Failed sessions kept 7 days
  - Failed session Week 1
  - Root cause identified Week 10 (requires original context)
  - Week 1 failed session: DELETED
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Fixed Retention Period**: 30 days doesn't account for project lifecycle
2. **No Archival Strategy**: Deleted data is gone forever (no cold storage)
3. **Failed Session Policy Too Aggressive**: 7 days insufficient for complex debugging
4. **No Value-Based Retention**: All sessions treated equally (high-value deleted same as low-value)

#### Early Warning Signs

- Team asking "where is the Context DNA from Week 2?"
- Bug investigations blocked by missing historical data
- Performance comparisons impossible (baseline deleted)
- Requests to increase retention period
- Attempts to manually backup Context DNA before deletion

#### How to Prevent It

**Option 1: Tiered Retention Policy (Recommended)**

```typescript
// Different retention periods based on value
class TieredRetentionPolicy {
  async cleanup(): Promise<void> {
    // Tier 1: Recent sessions (keep 60 days)
    const recent = Date.now() - (60 * 86400000);
    await this.deleteSessionsOlderThan(recent, { tier: "recent" });

    // Tier 2: High-value sessions (keep 180 days)
    // - Successful optimization runs
    // - Critical failure investigations
    // - Performance baselines
    const highValue = Date.now() - (180 * 86400000);
    await this.deleteSessionsOlderThan(highValue, { tier: "high-value" });

    // Tier 3: Failed sessions (keep 30 days)
    const failed = Date.now() - (30 * 86400000);
    await this.deleteFailedSessionsOlderThan(failed);

    // Tier 4: Cold storage (archive after 180 days)
    const archive = Date.now() - (180 * 86400000);
    await this.archiveSessionsOlderThan(archive);
  }

  async markHighValue(sessionId: string, reason: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.store.updateMetadata(sessionId, {
      tier: "high-value",
      reason,
      retainUntil: Date.now() + (180 * 86400000)
    });
  }
}

// Usage: Mark important sessions
await retentionPolicy.markHighValue(
  "session-week1-baseline",
  "Performance baseline for Q1 comparison"
);
```

**Option 2: Cold Storage Archive**

```typescript
// Archive old data to S3/local filesystem instead of deleting
class ArchivalStorage {
  async archiveSession(session: ContextDNA): Promise<void> {
    // Compress and archive to cold storage
    const compressed = await this.compress(session);

    await fs.writeFile(
      `.claude/.artifacts/archive/${session.session_id}.json.gz`,
      compressed
    );

    // Delete from active storage
    await this.store.delete(session.session_id);

    console.log(`Archived session ${session.session_id} (saved 95% space)`);
  }

  async retrieveArchived(sessionId: string): Promise<ContextDNA> {
    // Retrieve from archive (slower but available)
    const compressed = await fs.readFile(
      `.claude/.artifacts/archive/${sessionId}.json.gz`
    );

    const session = await this.decompress(compressed);
    return session;
  }
}

// Storage comparison:
// - Active: 500MB (recent sessions)
// - Archive: 2.5GB compressed (historical sessions)
// - Total: 3GB (vs 48GB without retention in v2)
```

**Option 3: Project-Based Retention**

```yaml
# retention-policy-v2.yaml
retention_policy:
  default: 30 days

  # Override for specific projects
  project_overrides:
    "spek-v2-rebuild":
      retention: 90 days       # Keep for full project lifecycle
      archive_after: 180 days  # Archive after 6 months

    "feature-auth-system":
      retention: 60 days       # Keep for feature lifecycle
      archive_after: 120 days

  # Session type overrides
  session_type_overrides:
    "optimization_run":
      retention: 180 days      # Keep optimization history longer
    "performance_baseline":
      retention: 365 days      # Keep baselines for annual comparison
    "failed_critical":
      retention: 60 days       # Keep critical failures longer
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Tiered Retention**: 60 days default, 180 days high-value, 30 days failed
2. **Cold Storage Archive**: Compress and archive instead of delete
3. **Project-Based Overrides**: Longer retention for active projects
4. **Mark High-Value Sessions**: Explicit retention for baselines, optimizations
5. **Archive Retrieval**: Slow but available for investigations

#### Success Metrics

- Data loss incidents: 0 (vs occasional during failure)
- Storage usage: <5GB (active + archive, vs 48GB unlimited)
- Root cause investigations: 100% successful (data available)
- Quarterly comparisons: Possible (baselines retained)
- Archive retrieval time: <5 seconds

---

### RISK #7: Parallel Development Coordination Overhead

**Risk Score**: 252 (42% probability x 2.0 impact x 10)
**Priority**: P3 - Nice to have
**Category**: Team coordination
**NEW**: V3's parallel Phase 2A/B/C development creates merge conflicts and coordination overhead

#### What Could Go Wrong?

PLAN-v3 parallelizes Phase 2 development:
- **Week 3**: Phase 2A (3 developers) + Phase 2B (2 developers) + Integration tests (1 developer)
- **Week 4**: Phase 2C (5 developers)

**Coordination Challenges**:

1. **Merge Conflicts**: 6 developers working concurrently on agent implementations
2. **Shared Files**: All agents import from `src/agents/AgentContract.ts`
3. **Test Conflicts**: Integration tests touch multiple agents simultaneously
4. **Protocol Changes**: Lightweight protocol changes affect all agents

**Example Failure**:

```
Week 3 Day 2:
  Team A (3 devs): Working on Phase 2A (coder, reviewer, researcher, planner, tester)
  Team B (2 devs): Working on Phase 2B (Queen, 3 Princesses)
  Team C (1 dev): Writing integration tests

Day 2 Afternoon:
  - Team A Developer 1 pushes CoderAgent implementation
  - Team A Developer 2 pushes ReviewerAgent implementation
  - Team B Developer 1 pushes PrincessAgent implementation
  - Team C Developer 1 pushes integration tests

Day 2 Evening: Merge conflicts
  - All 4 PRs modify src/agents/index.ts (export statement)
  - 3 PRs modify src/agents/AgentContract.ts (add helpers)
  - 2 PRs modify src/coordination/LightweightAgentProtocol.ts (add features)

  Merge resolution time: 2-3 hours
  Re-test time: 1 hour
  Total waste: 4 hours × 6 developers = 24 person-hours (3 person-days)

Week 3 Total:
  - 5 working days × 2 merge conflict sessions/day = 10 conflicts
  - 10 conflicts × 3 person-days = 30 person-days wasted
```

**Timeline Impact**:
- Week 3 planned: 6 developers × 5 days = 30 person-days
- Week 3 actual: 30 person-days - 30 wasted = 0 net progress
- Week 4: Carry over Phase 2A/B work
- **Total Delay**: 1+ week

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **No Branch Strategy**: All teams working on main/develop branch
2. **Shared Files**: AgentContract.ts touched by all teams
3. **No Code Ownership**: Multiple teams modifying same files
4. **No Coordination Schedule**: Teams pushing without coordination

#### Early Warning Signs

- Daily merge conflicts (>2 per day)
- PRs blocked waiting for other PRs to merge first
- Team Slack discussions about "who should merge first?"
- Developers working on branches for >2 days (fear of merge conflicts)
- CI/CD failures after merges (integration breaks)

#### How to Prevent It

**Option 1: Feature Branch Strategy (Recommended)**

```bash
# Each team works on isolated feature branch
git checkout -b phase-2a-core-agents        # Team A
git checkout -b phase-2b-swarm-coordinators # Team B
git checkout -b phase-2-integration-tests   # Team C

# Daily integration: Merge main → feature branches
git checkout phase-2a-core-agents
git merge main  # Pull in other teams' changes daily

# Weekly integration: Merge feature branches → main
# Monday: phase-2a-core-agents → main
# Tuesday: phase-2b-swarm-coordinators → main
# Wednesday: phase-2-integration-tests → main
```

**Option 2: Code Ownership and API Contracts**

```typescript
// Define API boundaries upfront (Week 2)
// src/agents/AgentContract.ts (FROZEN Week 3-4)
export interface AgentContract {
  // No changes allowed during Week 3-4
  // All teams implement this frozen interface
}

// Code ownership
// Team A owns: src/agents/core/*
// Team B owns: src/agents/swarm/*
// Team C owns: tests/integration/*
// No team modifies other team's directories
```

**Option 3: Daily Stand-up + Merge Coordination**

```yaml
# Daily coordination schedule
daily_schedule:
  9:00 AM: Stand-up (15 min)
    - Each team shares: What files will you modify today?
    - Identify conflicts BEFORE work starts

  12:00 PM: Mid-day sync (10 min)
    - Teams ready to push: Coordinate merge order

  4:00 PM: End-of-day merge window (30 min)
    - Team A pushes first (4:00-4:10 PM)
    - Team B pushes second (4:10-4:20 PM)
    - Team C pushes third (4:20-4:30 PM)
    - No concurrent pushes = no merge conflicts
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Feature Branch Strategy**: Each team on separate branch, merge weekly
2. **Freeze Shared Files**: AgentContract.ts frozen during Week 3-4
3. **Code Ownership**: Clear boundaries (core, swarm, tests)
4. **Daily Coordination**: Stand-up identifies conflicts before work
5. **Merge Windows**: Coordinated push times (no concurrent merges)

#### Success Metrics

- Merge conflicts: <2 per week (vs 10 during failure)
- Merge resolution time: <30 minutes (vs 3 hours during failure)
- CI/CD failures after merge: <10% (vs 40% during failure)
- Developer satisfaction: >=8/10 (smooth coordination)
- Net progress: >=90% of planned (vs 0% during failure)

---

## Recommendations for PLAN-v4 and SPEC-v4 (Final Iteration)

### Critical Changes Required (P0)

None. V3 successfully mitigated all P0 risks from v2.

### Important Changes (P1)

1. **Lightweight Protocol Extensibility**:
   - Add lightweight task tracking (in-memory, no database)
   - Support optional health checks (agent.getHealthCheck())
   - Implement middleware pattern for extensibility
   - Document when to use A2A for external integrations

2. **Facade Pattern Governance**:
   - Create decision matrix with 10-15 worked examples
   - Build GovernanceDecisionEngine for objective criteria
   - Add governance-examples.md command
   - Conduct 2-hour team training workshop

### Nice-to-Have Changes (P2-P3)

3. **Selective DSPy Optimization**:
   - Expand from 4 to 8 agents (still $0 cost)
   - Measure all 22 agent baselines first
   - Target system performance: 0.75 (weighted average)

4. **20s Sandbox Optimization**:
   - Implement async validation (commit-first, validate background)
   - Expand pre-warmed pool to 10 containers
   - Smart incremental (full tests for high-risk changes)

5. **AgentContract Consistency**:
   - Make all methods required with no-op defaults
   - Provide clear examples for FSM vs non-FSM agents
   - Add ESLint rule enforcing complete implementations

6. **Context DNA Retention**:
   - Implement tiered retention (60 days default, 180 days high-value)
   - Add cold storage archive instead of deletion
   - Support project-based retention overrides

7. **Parallel Development**:
   - Use feature branch strategy (team per branch)
   - Freeze shared files (AgentContract.ts) during Phase 2
   - Implement daily merge coordination windows

### Success Criteria for Iteration 4 (Production Release)

- [ ] Total Risk Score: <2,500 (achieved: 2,652)
- [ ] No P0 risks (achieved ✓)
- [ ] Architecture extensible for 85+ agents
- [ ] Governance decision time: <5 minutes average
- [ ] System performance: >=0.75 (weighted average)
- [ ] Developer velocity: <10% sandbox overhead
- [ ] Merge conflicts: <2 per week
- [ ] All 22 agents implementing AgentContract consistently

**Key Insight**: V3 successfully reduced total risk by 53% and eliminated all P0 risks. The remaining risks are manageable P1-P3 issues that can be addressed incrementally during implementation.

---

## Conclusion

Pre-mortem v3 analysis reveals that PLAN-v3/SPEC-v3 simplifications were **highly effective** at reducing complexity cascade risks from v2. Total risk decreased 53% (5,667 → 2,652), and all P0 risks were eliminated.

However, 7 NEW risks emerged from over-simplification:

**Top 3 Concerns**:
1. Lightweight protocol too simple for future 63+ agent expansion (P1)
2. Facade pattern creates governance decision ambiguity (P1)
3. Selective DSPy leaves 18 agents with poor performance (P2)

**Bottom Line**: V3 is production-ready with minor enhancements. Recommend proceeding to Iteration 4 (final implementation) with P1 mitigations integrated. P2-P3 risks can be addressed post-launch.

**Go/No-Go Decision**: **GO** ✓
