## Risk Mitigation

### Known Risks

**1. Agent Complexity** (Medium):
- **Risk**: 22 agents in 7 days (3.1 agents/day average)
- **Mitigation**: Parallel implementation Days 4-6 (5-5-5 pattern)
- **Fallback**: Reduce to 18 agents if needed (drop 4 specialized)

**2. Integration Testing** (Medium):
- **Risk**: Complex multi-agent coordination
- **Mitigation**: Incremental testing (daily audits)
- **Fallback**: Week 6 buffer for integration issues

**3. Performance Validation** (Low):
- **Risk**: <100ms latency target
- **Mitigation**: EnhancedLightweightProtocol (direct method calls)
- **Fallback**: Optimize protocol if needed

---

## Daily Audit Process

**End of Each Day**:
1. Run analyzer on all new code
2. Generate audit report
3. Fix critical issues immediately
4. Document implementation summary
5. Update todo list for next day

**Analyzer Command**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive analysis
python -m analyzer.api --path src/agents --output docs/WEEK-5-DAY-X-AUDIT.md

# Key metrics to track
# - NASA compliance (target ≥90%)
# - God object detection (target 0)
# - Theater detection (target <10)
# - Cyclomatic complexity (target <10)
```

## Success Criteria

**Week 5 Complete** when:
- ✅ All 22 agents implemented
- ✅ AgentContract compliance validated
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ Performance targets met (<100ms)
- ✅ Code quality gates passed (≥90% NASA)
- ✅ Documentation complete

**Go/No-Go for Week 6**:
- If all criteria met → Proceed to Atlantis UI implementation
- If critical issues → Use Week 6 buffer for fixes
