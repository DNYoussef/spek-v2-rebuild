## SPARC Workflow Integration

### SPARC Phase Mapping

**Specification Phase** → **Spec-Writer Agent**
- Captures functional and non-functional requirements
- Documents edge cases and constraints
- Defines acceptance criteria

**Pseudocode Phase** → **Pseudocode-Writer Agent**
- Translates specifications into algorithms
- Designs data structures
- Analyzes complexity

**Architecture Phase** → **Architect Agent**
- Designs system architecture
- Selects technology stack and patterns
- Plans scalability and security

**Completion Phase** → **Integration-Engineer Agent**
- Integrates components into working system
- Runs integration tests
- Deploys to production

### SPARC Workflow Example

```
1. Spec-Writer: Capture requirement "Process data efficiently"
   → Functional requirement FR-001
   → Non-functional requirement NFR-001 (performance <100ms)
   → Constraint CON-001 (>=80% test coverage)

2. Pseudocode-Writer: Design algorithm for FR-001
   → Step 1: Validate inputs (O(1))
   → Step 2: Process data (O(n))
   → Step 3: Return result (O(1))
   → Time complexity: O(n)
   → Space complexity: O(1)

3. Architect: Design system architecture
   → Component: DataProcessor (microservice)
   → Technology: Python 3.11 + FastAPI
   → Pattern: Layered architecture
   → Scalability: Horizontal scaling with containers

4. Integration-Engineer: Integrate and deploy
   → Integration point: API → DataProcessor
   → Integration tests: 10/10 passed
   → Deployment: staging → production
   → Status: success
```

## Agent Delegation Patterns

### Architect Agent: Design Pattern Selection

**Pattern**: Conditional design based on architecture style

**Example**:
```python
{
  "specification_file": "specs/SPEC-v6-FINAL.md",
  "style": "microservices",
  "output_file": "architecture/ARCHITECTURE-DESIGN.md"
}
```

**Design Output**:
- Components: API Gateway, Services, Database
- Technology Stack: Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis
- Design Patterns: Service mesh, API gateway, event sourcing
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling with container orchestration
- Security: JWT, HTTPS/TLS, input validation, rate limiting

---

### Pseudocode-Writer Agent: Algorithm Steps

**Pattern**: Step-by-step algorithm with complexity analysis

**Example**:
```python
{
  "specification_file": "specs/FR-001.md",
  "function_name": "process_data",
  "output_file": "docs/pseudocode/process_data.md"
}
```

**Pseudocode Output**:
```
Step 1: Validate inputs
  IF inputs are invalid THEN return error
  Complexity: O(1)

Step 2: Process data
  FOR EACH item IN data DO process(item)
  Complexity: O(n)

Step 3: Return result
  RETURN processed_result
  Complexity: O(1)
```

**Complexity Analysis**: O(n) time, O(1) space

---

### Spec-Writer Agent: Requirements Extraction

**Pattern**: Categorized requirements with acceptance criteria

**Example**:
```python
{
  "input_file": "research/feature-request.md",
  "title": "Data Processing System",
  "output_file": "specs/SPEC-DATA-PROCESSING.md"
}
```

**Specification Output**:
- Functional Requirements (FR-001, FR-002, ...)
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-001: performance, NFR-002: uptime)
- Constraints (CON-001: latency <100ms, CON-002: coverage ≥80%)
- Edge Cases (empty input, invalid types, network failures)
- Success Metrics (test coverage, NASA compliance, performance)

---

### Integration-Engineer Agent: Component Integration

**Pattern**: Integration point identification + strategy execution

**Example**:
```python
{
  "components": ["APIGateway", "DataProcessor", "Database"],
  "integration_plan": {
    "dependencies": {
      "APIGateway": ["DataProcessor"],
      "DataProcessor": ["Database"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Integration Flow**:
1. Identify integration points (APIGateway → DataProcessor, DataProcessor → Database)
2. Select integration strategies (API, database)
3. Execute integration for each point
4. Run integration tests
5. Deploy to staging/production

---

## Performance Validation

### Latency Targets

| Component | Target | Expected | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Task Validation | <5ms | <5ms | ✅ |
| Architect Design | <200ms | <200ms | ✅ |
| Pseudocode Generation | <150ms | <150ms | ✅ |
| Spec Writing | <200ms | <200ms | ✅ |
| Integration Execution | <500ms | <500ms | ✅ |

**Notes**:
- All specialized agents inherit AgentBase validation (<5ms)
- Design/writing tasks are I/O-bound (file operations)
- Integration tasks may involve external system calls
