       bgcolor="#f3e5f5";

       "/api/monarch/chat" [shape=box];
       "/api/project/index" [shape=box];
       // ... all 27 endpoints
   }
   ```

2. **Add WebSocket Integration Subgraph**:
   ```dot
   subgraph cluster_websocket {
       label="WebSocket Integration (Socket.io + Redis Pub/Sub)";
       bgcolor="#f1f8e9";

       "Socket.io server setup" [shape=box];

3. **Add Missing Components to Relevant Clusters**:
   - Add `<VectorizationProgress />` to existing project flow
   - Add `<ResearchArtifacts />` and `<PremortemReport />` to Loop 1
   - Add `<AuditPipeline />` to Loop 2 audit
   - Add `<PhaseProgress />` and `<DependencyGraph />` to phase completion

4. **Add Princess-Documentation**:
   ```dot
   "Princess-Documentation (docs-writer, spec-writer)" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];
   "Assign tasks to Princesses" -> "Princess-Documentation (docs-writer, spec-writer)";
   "Princess-Documentation (docs-writer, spec-writer)" -> "Drones execute tasks";
   ```

5. **Add `/dashboard` Page Flow**:
   ```dot
   subgraph cluster_dashboard {
       label="/dashboard - Overall Progress";
       bgcolor="#fce4ec";

       "User navigates to dashboard" [shape=ellipse];
       "<ProgressOverview />" [shape=box];
       "<PhaseTimeline />" [shape=box];
       "Tabs: Overview / Phases / Agents" [shape=box];
   }
   ```

6. **Add MCP Integration Subgraph**:
   ```dot
   subgraph cluster_mcp_servers {
       label="MCP Server Integration";
       bgcolor="#e8eaf6";

       "GitHub MCP (repo, projects, issues)" [shape=box];
       "Chrome MCP (Playwright screenshots)" [shape=box];
       "Memory MCP (cross-agent state)" [shape=box];
       "Filesystem MCP (project indexing)" [shape=box];
   }
   ```

### Documentation Enhancements

1. **Create Companion API Documentation**:
   - Separate file: `atlantis-ui-api-endpoints.md`
   - Document all 27 API endpoints with request/response schemas
   - Link from .dot file comment

2. **Create Companion Component Library**:
   - Separate file: `atlantis-ui-component-library.md`
   - Document all 40+ components with props, usage examples
   - Link from .dot file comment

3. **Create Companion WebSocket Events**:
   - Separate file: `atlantis-ui-websocket-events.md`
   - Document all real-time events, throttling rules, reconnection handling
   - Link from .dot file comment

## Conclusion

**Overall Coverage**: 73% COMPLETE

### Strengths
- ✅ Core user flows (existing project, new project, 3-loop system) fully captured
- ✅ 3-stage audit system excellently detailed
- ✅ Performance targets comprehensively specified
- ✅ Critical implementation rules clearly stated
- ✅ Visual design principles well-covered

### Weaknesses
- ⚠️ API endpoint specifications completely missing (27 endpoints)
- ⚠️ WebSocket integration details incomplete
- ⚠️ 14 components not explicitly shown in workflow
- ⚠️ MCP server integration not specified
- ⚠️ `/dashboard` page missing
- ⚠️ Princess-Documentation agent group missing
- ⚠️ Reusable components (cards, tabs, modals) mostly missing

### Recommendation
**Action Required**: Add HIGH PRIORITY items (6 categories, ~50 missing specifications) to achieve 95%+ coverage before Week 7-18 implementation begins.
