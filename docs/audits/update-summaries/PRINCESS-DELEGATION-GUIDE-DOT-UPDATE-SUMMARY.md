## Design Decisions

### 1. Princess-Based Cluster Organization

**Decision**: 3 large clusters organized by Princess coordinator

**Rationale**:
- Matches delegation model: Queen → Princess → Drone
- Clear ownership: Each Princess owns a set of drone agents
- Logical grouping: All routing logic for one Princess in one visual area

**Benefits**:
- Stakeholders can see complete routing path: Queen → Princess-Dev → frontend-dev
- Easy navigation: "How does Princess-Quality route tasks?" → jump to `cluster_princess_quality`
- Visual hierarchy: 3 top-level coordinators, 15 specialized drones

### 2. Routing Decision Flow with Priority

**Decision**: Show routing methods in priority order (Task Type → Keyword → Fallback)

**Rationale**:
- Matches actual routing implementation: Task type checked first, then keywords, then fallback
- Visual clarity: Decision diamonds stacked vertically by priority
- Debugging aid: Developers can trace routing path top-to-bottom

**Example** (Princess-Dev routing):
```dot
dev_routing_decision -> dev_keyword_check [label="1. Keywords first"];
dev_routing_decision -> dev_task_type_check [label="2. Task type"];
dev_routing_decision -> drone_coder [label="3. Fallback"];
```

### 3. Keyword Analysis as Decision Diamonds

**Decision**: Use decision diamonds for keyword presence checks

**Rationale**:
- Visual clarity: Diamond shape indicates "Does task description contain these keywords?"
- Binary decision: YES (route to specialized drone) or NO (continue to next check)
- Matches implementation: `any(kw in desc_lower for kw in [...])`

**Example**:
```dot
dev_frontend_keywords [label="Frontend keywords?\n(ui, component, react,\nfrontend, typescript,\njsx, css, style)", shape=diamond, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];
dev_frontend_keywords -> drone_frontend [label="YES"];
dev_frontend_keywords -> dev_backend_keywords [label="NO"];
```

### 4. Drone Agent Metadata in Nodes

**Decision**: Each drone agent node contains task types, keywords, and priority

**Rationale**:
- Complete reference: Developers see what triggers routing to this drone
- Priority levels: HIGH (specialized), MEDIUM (general), MEDIUM (fallback)
- Color coding: lightyellow (HIGH), orange (fallback)

**Example**:
```dot
drone_frontend [label="frontend-dev\nPriority: HIGH\nKeywords: ui, component, react, frontend\nTask Types: implement-component, implement-ui, optimize-rendering, implement-styles", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightyellow];
```

### 5. Routing Decision Matrix as Reference Cluster

**Decision**: Create dedicated cluster with quick reference table

**Rationale**:
- Fast lookup: Developers can quickly find "If task mentions X, routes to Y"
- Visual summary: All 8 routing patterns in one place
- Complements detailed routing logic: Matrix for quick reference, clusters for detailed flow

**Implementation**:
```dot
subgraph cluster_decision_matrix {
  label="Routing Decision Matrix - Quick Reference";
  matrix_frontend [label="UI, component, React, frontend\n→ frontend-dev (Princess-Dev)", shape=box];
  matrix_backend [label="API, database, endpoint, backend\n→ backend-dev (Princess-Dev)", shape=box];
  ...
}
```

### 6. Troubleshooting as Dedicated Cluster

**Decision**: Create troubleshooting cluster with 3 common issues

**Rationale**:
- Actionable guidance: Developers can diagnose routing problems
- Cause + solution: Each issue node has both diagnosis and fix
- Orange color: Indicates warning/problem nodes

**Example**:
```dot
issue_1 [label="Issue 1: Task routes to wrong agent\nCause: Generic task type without keywords\nSolution: Use specific keywords in description", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=orange];
```

### 7. Best Practices as Dedicated Cluster

**Decision**: Create best practices cluster with 4 practices (good/bad examples)

**Rationale**:
- Prescriptive guidance: Shows correct way to structure tasks
- Good/bad examples: ✅ vs ❌ visual indicators
- Reduces routing errors: Developers follow patterns that route correctly

**Implementation**:
```dot
practice_1 [label="1. Use specific task types\n✅ implement-component\n❌ code (too generic)", shape=box];
```

### 8. Performance Metrics as Dedicated Cluster

**Decision**: Create performance cluster with 4 latency metrics

**Rationale**:
- Performance visibility: Shows routing is fast (<5ms total)
- Target vs actual: Demonstrates system meets performance goals
- Green color: Indicates success metrics

**Example**:
```dot
perf_keyword [label="Keyword analysis: <1ms (actual: 0.3ms)", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightgreen];
```

## Key Workflows Captured

### 1. Princess-Dev Routing: Frontend Task

**Workflow**: User creates task → Queen receives → Princess-Dev selected → Keyword analysis → frontend-dev

**Routing Logic**:
1. **Keyword Analysis**: Check description for frontend keywords (ui, component, react, frontend, typescript, jsx, css, style)
2. **If YES**: Route to frontend-dev (HIGH priority)
3. **If NO**: Continue to backend keyword check

**Example Task**:
```python
Task(
    task_type="code",
    description="Create React component for user profile"
)
# Routes to: frontend-dev (keywords "React", "component")
```

**Captured in .dot**: Complete flow with keyword decision diamond and drone agent node (lines 50-85 of .dot file)

### 2. Princess-Dev Routing: Backend Task

**Workflow**: User creates task → Queen receives → Princess-Dev selected → Keyword analysis → backend-dev

**Routing Logic**:
1. **Keyword Analysis**: Check description for backend keywords (api, database, endpoint, backend, server, sql, rest, graphql)
2. **If YES**: Route to backend-dev (HIGH priority)
3. **If NO**: Continue to task type check

**Example Task**:
```python
Task(
    task_type="implement-api",
    description="Create user management endpoint"
)
# Routes to: backend-dev (task type match)
```

**Captured in .dot**: Complete flow with keyword decision diamond and task type mapping (lines 85-110 of .dot file)

### 3. Princess-Quality Routing: Code Analysis

**Workflow**: User creates task → Queen receives → Princess-Quality selected → Task type match → code-analyzer

**Routing Logic**:
1. **Task Type Mapping**: Check if task_type in [analyze-code, detect-complexity, detect-duplicates, analyze-dependencies]
2. **If YES**: Route to code-analyzer (HIGH priority, NEW agent)
3. **If NO**: Continue to tester task type check

**Example Task**:
```python
Task(
    task_type="analyze-code",
    description="Analyze module for complexity and duplicates"
)
# Routes to: code-analyzer (task type match)
```

**Captured in .dot**: Complete flow with task type decision diamonds (lines 140-165 of .dot file)

### 4. Princess-Coordination Routing: Infrastructure Task

**Workflow**: User creates task → Queen receives → Princess-Coordination selected → Keyword analysis → infrastructure-ops

**Routing Logic**:
1. **Keyword Analysis**: Check description for infrastructure keywords (kubernetes, k8s, docker, cloud, infrastructure, helm, terraform)
2. **If YES**: Route to infrastructure-ops (HIGH priority, NEW agent)
3. **If NO**: Continue to release keyword check

**Example Task**:
```python
Task(
    task_type="coordinate",
    description="Deploy microservices to Kubernetes cluster"
)
# Routes to: infrastructure-ops (keywords "Deploy", "Kubernetes")
```

**Captured in .dot**: Complete flow with keyword decision diamond (lines 200-225 of .dot file)

### Navigation Tips

**By Princess** (find specific coordinator's routing logic):
```
cluster_princess_dev → Princess-Dev (4 drones: frontend-dev, backend-dev, coder, researcher)
cluster_princess_quality → Princess-Quality (5 drones: code-analyzer, tester, reviewer, nasa-enforcer, theater-detector)
cluster_princess_coordination → Princess-Coordination (6 drones: infrastructure-ops, release-manager, performance-engineer, orchestrator, planner, cost-tracker)
```

**By Drone Agent** (find specific agent):
```
drone_frontend → frontend-dev (Princess-Dev, HIGH priority)
drone_backend → backend-dev (Princess-Dev, HIGH priority)
drone_analyzer → code-analyzer (Princess-Quality, HIGH priority, NEW)
drone_infra → infrastructure-ops (Princess-Coordination, HIGH priority, NEW)
drone_release → release-manager (Princess-Coordination, HIGH priority, NEW)
drone_perf → performance-engineer (Princess-Coordination, HIGH priority, NEW)
```

**By Routing Method** (understand routing priority):
```
cluster_priority → Routing Priority (3 levels)
  1. Task Type Match (Highest)
  2. Keyword Analysis (Medium)
  3. Fallback Chain (Lowest)
```

**By Quick Reference** (fast keyword lookup):
```
cluster_decision_matrix → Routing Decision Matrix
  - UI, component, React → frontend-dev
  - API, database, endpoint → backend-dev
  - analyze, complexity → code-analyzer
  - Kubernetes, Docker → infrastructure-ops
  - release, version → release-manager
  - performance, optimize → performance-engineer
```

### Common Workflows

**Workflow 1: Understand Princess-Dev Routing**
1. Start at princess_select decision diamond
2. Follow "Development work" edge to cluster_princess_dev
3. Review princess_dev_entry (agent ID, responsibility, routing methods)
4. Trace routing priority:
   - dev_keyword_check → dev_frontend_keywords → drone_frontend (if YES)
   - dev_keyword_check → dev_backend_keywords → drone_backend (if YES)
   - dev_task_type_check → dev_frontend_task_types → drone_frontend (if YES)
   - dev_task_type_check → dev_backend_task_types → drone_backend (if YES)
   - Fallback → drone_coder

**Workflow 2: Diagnose Routing Issue**
1. Navigate to cluster_troubleshooting
2. Review issue_1 (task routes to wrong agent)
   - Cause: Generic task type without keywords
   - Solution: Use specific keywords in description
3. Review issue_2 (agent not found error)
   - Cause: Agent not registered in Princess
   - Solution: Verify agent in drone_agents dictionary
4. Review issue_3 (multiple keywords match)
   - Cause: Ambiguous task (UI + API)
   - Solution: Split into separate tasks

**Workflow 3: Follow Best Practices**
1. Navigate to cluster_best_practices
2. Review practice_1 (use specific task types)
   - ✅ Good: implement-component, implement-api, analyze-code
   - ❌ Bad: code, work (too generic)
3. Review practice_2 (include domain keywords)
   - ✅ Good: "Create React TypeScript component for user profile"
   - ❌ Bad: "Create user profile" (no keywords)
4. Review practice_3 (one responsibility per task)
   - ✅ Good: Split UI and API tasks
   - ❌ Bad: "Full-stack dashboard with UI and API" (ambiguous)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Princess-Based Clustering Matches Delegation Model
**Challenge**: How to organize routing logic for 28 agents across 3 coordinators?

**Solution**: Create 3 large clusters (one per Princess) with nested routing logic

**Outcome**: Visual hierarchy matches delegation model (Queen → Princess → Drone), easy to trace routing path

### 2. Decision Diamonds for Routing Priority
**Challenge**: How to show routing priority (task type → keyword → fallback)?

**Solution**: Stack decision diamonds vertically with priority labels (1, 2, 3)

**Outcome**: Developers can trace routing logic top-to-bottom, understand fallback chain

### 3. Keyword Analysis as Binary Decisions
**Challenge**: How to visualize keyword presence checks?

**Solution**: Use decision diamonds with YES/NO branches (if keywords found → specialized drone, else → continue)

**Outcome**: Clear binary logic, matches implementation (`any(kw in desc_lower for kw in [...])`)

### 4. Reference Clusters for Quick Lookup
**Challenge**: Developers need fast lookup: "If task mentions X, routes to Y"

**Solution**: Create dedicated decision matrix cluster with 8 routing patterns

**Outcome**: Fast lookup without navigating full routing logic, complements detailed clusters

### 5. Troubleshooting Cluster Reduces Support Burden
**Challenge**: Common routing issues need actionable solutions

**Solution**: Create troubleshooting cluster with cause + solution for each issue

**Outcome**: Developers can self-diagnose routing problems, reduces need for support
