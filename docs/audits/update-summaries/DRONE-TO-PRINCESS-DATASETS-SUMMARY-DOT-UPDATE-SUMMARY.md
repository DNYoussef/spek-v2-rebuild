## Overview

Successfully converted DRONE_TO_PRINCESS_DATASETS_SUMMARY.md to a comprehensive GraphViz .dot workflow capturing complete DSPy training datasets for Princess Hive delegation optimization. The .dot file provides detailed dataset structure for all 3 Princesses (28 drones total), routing logic, DSPy optimization process, and integration roadmap.

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Dataset-Centric Organization (9 Clusters)

Organized into 9 major clusters focused on DSPy optimization:

1. **OVERVIEW**: Purpose (optimize Princess delegation), architecture (3-tier: Queen → Princess → Drone), routing methods (3), datasets summary (3 Princesses, 28 Drones)
2. **PRINCESS-DEV DATASET**: 9 drones (coder, frontend-dev, backend-dev, architect, pseudocode-writer, debugger, integration-engineer, devops, code-analyzer), keyword sets, training examples (5), metrics
3. **PRINCESS-QUALITY DATASET**: 10 drones (tester, reviewer, security-manager, theater-detector, nasa-enforcer, fsm-analyzer, performance-engineer, cost-tracker, release-manager, infrastructure-ops), keyword sets, training examples (6), metrics
4. **PRINCESS-COORDINATION DATASET**: 9 drones (researcher, spec-writer, docs-writer, planner, orchestrator, queen, princess-dev, princess-quality, princess-coordination), keyword sets, training examples (6), metrics
5. **ROUTING LOGIC**: 3 methods (task type matching HIGH >90% <50ms, keyword analysis MEDIUM >85% <75ms, fallback chains LOW >70% <100ms), decision workflow
6. **DSPY OPTIMIZATION**: 4-step process (collect data, train modules, validate performance, A/B testing), A/B test decision (pass → rollout, fail → rollback → retry)
7. **PERFORMANCE METRICS**: Baseline (80-85% accuracy), Target (>95% accuracy), Optimized (95-98% accuracy), ROI analysis (150% return, 15x ROI)
8. **INTEGRATION PATTERN**: 5 steps (embed datasets, load in Princess, route with DSPy, fallback handling, logging/monitoring)
9. **NEXT STEPS**: 5-step roadmap (dataset creation Week 6, DSPy training Week 6, integration Week 6, A/B testing Week 6, rollout Week 7)

**Rationale**: DSPy dataset summary requires clear Princess-by-Princess breakdown with implementation roadmap.

### 2. Complete Keyword Sets for All 28 Drones

Created exhaustive keyword listings:
- **Princess-Dev** (9 drones): coder ["implement", "code", "function", "class", "write code"], frontend-dev ["ui", "component", "react", "frontend", "typescript"], backend-dev ["api", "endpoint", "route", "backend", "server"], architect ["design", "architecture", "system", "structure", "pattern"], pseudocode-writer ["algorithm", "pseudocode", "logic", "steps", "flow"], debugger ["bug", "fix", "debug", "error", "issue"], integration-engineer ["integrate", "connect", "link", "combine", "merge"], devops ["deploy", "ci/cd", "pipeline", "release", "production"], code-analyzer ["analyze", "lint", "scan", "review", "inspect"]
- **Princess-Quality** (10 drones): tester ["test", "testing", "unit test", "integration test", "coverage"], reviewer ["review", "code review", "feedback", "approve", "reject"], security-manager ["security", "vulnerability", "penetration test", "owasp", "authentication"], theater-detector ["theater", "mock", "fake", "placeholder", "todo"], nasa-enforcer ["nasa", "compliance", "loc", "function size", "rule 10"], fsm-analyzer ["fsm", "state machine", "transitions", "states", "complexity"], performance-engineer ["performance", "optimize", "speed", "latency", "throughput"], cost-tracker ["cost", "budget", "pricing", "expense", "billing"], release-manager ["release", "version", "changelog", "deploy", "rollout"], infrastructure-ops ["kubernetes", "docker", "container", "k8s", "deployment"]
- **Princess-Coordination** (9 drones): researcher ["research", "analyze", "investigate", "study", "explore"], spec-writer ["spec", "requirements", "specification", "document requirements", "define"], docs-writer ["documentation", "docs", "readme", "guide", "manual"], planner ["plan", "schedule", "timeline", "roadmap", "task list"], orchestrator ["orchestrate", "coordinate", "workflow", "pipeline", "sequence"], queen ["delegate", "assign", "distribute", "coordinate all", "top level"], princess-dev ["coordinate dev", "development coordination", "dev tasks", "code coordination"], princess-quality ["coordinate qa", "quality coordination", "test coordination", "qa tasks"], princess-coordination ["coordinate tasks", "task coordination", "workflow coordination", "meta coordination"]

**Rationale**: Complete keyword sets enable DSPy training dataset creation and keyword matching fallback.

### 3. Training Examples with Q/A Format

Created representative training examples for each Princess:
- **Princess-Dev** (5 examples): "Implement user authentication" → coder, "Design React component for dashboard" → frontend-dev, "Create REST API endpoint for users" → backend-dev, "Debug login failure issue" → debugger, "Analyze code for security vulnerabilities" → code-analyzer
- **Princess-Quality** (6 examples): "Create unit tests for auth module" → tester, "Review pull request for security issues" → reviewer + security-manager, "Validate NASA Rule 10 compliance" → nasa-enforcer, "Scan codebase for theater code" → theater-detector, "Optimize database query performance" → performance-engineer, "Deploy to Kubernetes production cluster" → infrastructure-ops
- **Princess-Coordination** (6 examples): "Research best practices for API design" → researcher, "Write specification for user management feature" → spec-writer, "Generate documentation for REST API" → docs-writer, "Create project plan for next sprint" → planner, "Orchestrate multi-agent workflow for code generation" → orchestrator, "Coordinate all agents for project completion" → queen

**Rationale**: Q/A format provides concrete examples for DSPy training and human validation.

### 4. ROI Quantification

Calculated complete ROI analysis:
- **Training cost**: ~$50 (one-time, Gemini free tier for training)
- **Inference cost**: ~$5/month (marginal, minimal per-request overhead)
- **Benefit**: 15% accuracy improvement
  - = 15% fewer misroutes (from 10-15% fallback to 2-3% fallback)
  - = 15% faster task completion (correct drone assigned first time)
  - = $75/month value (estimated time savings)
- **ROI**: 150% (15x return: $75 benefit / $5 monthly cost)

**Rationale**: Executive decision-making requires quantified ROI, not just accuracy improvement.

### 5. A/B Testing Workflow with Retry Loop

Created complete A/B testing decision workflow:
- **Step 4 node**: A/B Testing details (deploy optimized alongside baseline, split traffic 50/50, monitor metrics 7 days, decision: rollout or rollback)
- **Gate diamond**: "A/B Test Passed?"
- **Pass path**: Rollout (replace baseline with optimized Princess)
- **Fail path**: Rollback (keep baseline, iterate on training)
- **Retry edge**: Dashed edge from rollback back to Step 1 (collect training data) for iteration

**Rationale**: A/B testing is standard practice for ML deployment, explicit failure handling with iteration loop essential.

## Key Workflows Captured

### 1. Princess-Dev Routing Workflow

**9 drones with keyword-based routing**:
```
Entry → Navigation → Princess-Dev Dataset Cluster
  → Scope: Development coordination, 9 specialized drones, Focus: Implementation tasks
  → 9 Drones:
    1. coder (code implementation) - keywords: ["implement", "code", "function", "class", "write code"]
    2. frontend-dev (UI development) - keywords: ["ui", "component", "react", "frontend", "typescript"]
    3. backend-dev (API development) - keywords: ["api", "endpoint", "route", "backend", "server"]
    4. architect (system design) - keywords: ["design", "architecture", "system", "structure", "pattern"]
    5. pseudocode-writer (algorithm design) - keywords: ["algorithm", "pseudocode", "logic", "steps", "flow"]
    6. debugger (bug fixing) - keywords: ["bug", "fix", "debug", "error", "issue"]
    7. integration-engineer (component integration) - keywords: ["integrate", "connect", "link", "combine", "merge"]
    8. devops (deployment automation) - keywords: ["deploy", "ci/cd", "pipeline", "release", "production"]
    9. code-analyzer (static analysis) - keywords: ["analyze", "lint", "scan", "review", "inspect"]
  → Training Examples (5):
    Q: "Implement user authentication" → A: coder
    Q: "Design React component for dashboard" → A: frontend-dev
    Q: "Create REST API endpoint for users" → A: backend-dev
    Q: "Debug login failure issue" → A: debugger
    Q: "Analyze code for security vulnerabilities" → A: code-analyzer
  → Success Metrics:
    - Routing accuracy: >95%
    - Latency: <100ms
    - Fallback rate: <5%
    - Keyword match rate: >90%
  → Exit
```

**Routing flow**:
1. Extract task description: "Implement user authentication"
2. Extract keywords: ["implement", "user", "authentication"]
3. Match keywords to drone keyword sets: coder ["implement", "code", "function", "class", "write code"]
4. Compute overlap score: coder = 1/5 = 20%
5. Rank drones by overlap score: coder (20%), frontend-dev (0%), backend-dev (0%), ...
6. Return top-ranked drone: coder

### 2. DSPy Optimization Process Workflow

**4-step optimization with A/B test**:
```
Entry → Navigation → DSPy Optimization Cluster
  → Step 1: Collect Training Data
    → Gather task → drone assignments (100-200 examples per Princess)
    → Label with ground truth (manual validation)
    → Split train/validation (80/20)
    → Total: 300-600 examples across 3 Princesses
  → Step 2: Train DSPy Modules
    → Use ChainOfThought for reasoning (explicit step-by-step)
    → Use ReAct for multi-step tasks (reason + act cycle)
    → Optimize with BootstrapFewShot (automatic prompt optimization)
    → Target: >95% validation accuracy
  → Step 3: Validate Performance
    → Test on validation set (20% held-out data)
    → Measure accuracy (correct drone assigned / total tasks)
    → Measure latency (time to route task)
    → Measure fallback rate (tasks escalated to Queen)
    → Compare baseline (80-85% accuracy) vs optimized (95-98% accuracy)
    → Target: +10-20% accuracy improvement
  → Step 4: A/B Testing
    → Deploy optimized Princess alongside baseline
    → Split traffic 50/50 (random assignment)
    → Monitor metrics for 7 days:
      - Accuracy: baseline vs optimized
      - Latency: maintain <100ms
      - Cost: inference cost ~$5/month
    → Decision: rollout or rollback
  → A/B Test Gate: "A/B Test Passed?"
    [Pass] → Rollout
      → Replace baseline with optimized Princess
      → Monitor for 30 days
      → Periodic retraining (monthly)
      → Exit
    [Fail] → Rollback
      → Keep baseline Princess
      → Iterate on training (collect more data, adjust hyperparameters)
      → Retry from Step 1 (loop back)
```

**Success criteria**:
- **Pass**: Optimized accuracy ≥baseline + 10%, latency maintained <100ms, cost acceptable
- **Fail**: Optimized accuracy <baseline + 10%, latency increased >100ms, or cost excessive

### 3. Performance Metrics Comparison Workflow

**Baseline → Target → Optimized progression**:
```
Entry → Navigation → Performance Metrics Cluster
  → Baseline (No DSPy):
    - Routing accuracy: 80-85% (keyword matching only)
    - Latency: <100ms (keyword matching fast)
    - Fallback rate: 10-15% (frequent misroutes)
    - Manual intervention: 5% (Queen escalation)
  → Target (With DSPy):
    - Routing accuracy: >95% (DSPy reasoning)
    - Latency: <100ms (maintained)
    - Fallback rate: <5% (reduced misroutes)
    - Manual intervention: <1% (rare escalation)
  → Optimized (Expected):
    - Routing accuracy: 95-98% (DSPy trained on real data)
    - Latency: <100ms ✅ (maintained)
    - Fallback rate: 2-3% (minimal misroutes)
    - Manual intervention: <0.5% (very rare escalation)
    - Improvement: +10-15% accuracy (from 80-85% to 95-98%)
  → ROI Analysis:
    - Training cost: ~$50 (one-time, Gemini free tier)
    - Inference cost: ~$5/month (marginal overhead)
    - Benefit calculation:
      - 15% accuracy improvement
      - = 15% fewer misroutes (from 10-15% to 2-3% fallback)
      - = 15% faster task completion (correct drone first time)
      - = $75/month value (estimated time savings: 100 tasks/day * 15% * 5min/task * $1/min = $75/month)
    - ROI: 150% (benefit $75 / cost $5 = 15x return)
  → Exit
```

**Improvement breakdown**:
- **Accuracy**: +10-15 percentage points (80-85% → 95-98%)
- **Fallback rate**: -7-13 percentage points (10-15% → 2-3%)
- **Manual intervention**: -4.5 percentage points (5% → 0.5%)
- **Value**: $75/month time savings (15% faster task completion)
