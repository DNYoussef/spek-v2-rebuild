---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Cluster Organization Strategy

**Decision**: 15 clusters organized by functional area (UI pages, supporting systems, enhancements)

**Rationale**:
- **UI Pages** (9 clusters): Clear separation matching user navigation (`cluster_home`, `cluster_project_select`, etc.)
- **Supporting Systems** (4 clusters): Backend, agents, real-time, audit system
- **Technical Requirements** (2 clusters): Executive summary, technical specs

**Benefits**:
- Matches mental model of stakeholders reviewing UI workflows
- Easy to navigate: "Show me the /loop2/audit page" → jump to `cluster_audit`
- Logical grouping reduces visual clutter (984 lines manageable)

### 2. Node Shape Semantics

**Decision**: Use semantic shapes to convey node type at a glance

| Shape | Meaning | Example | Count |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| `[shape=diamond]` | Decision point | "Cache hit?" | 40+ |
| `[shape=box]` | Action/Process | "Run vectorization" | 90+ |
| `[shape=plaintext]` | Trigger/Event | "User clicks button" | 15+ |
| `[shape=octagon]` | Critical warning | "GPU <400MB fallback" | 5+ |
| `[shape=ellipse]` | Entry point | "START: User lands on /" | 10+ |
| `[shape=doublecircle]` | Exit point | "END: Display graph" | 10+ |

**Rationale**: Visual grammar reduces cognitive load (shapes convey meaning without reading labels)

### 3. Color Coding Strategy

**Decision**: Use colors to indicate status and priority

| Color | Meaning | Example | Usage |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| `lightgreen` | Complete/Success | "COMPLETE: Week 5" | 30+ nodes |
| `lightyellow` | Future/Pending | "PENDING: Week 10" | 20+ nodes |
| `lightblue` | Performance optimization | "Cache check" | 25+ nodes |
| `orange` | Important/Warning | "Fallback to 2D" | 15+ nodes |
| `red` | Critical/Blocking | "Theater score ≥10 BLOCKED" | 10+ nodes |

**Rationale**: Color reinforces semantic meaning (red = danger, green = success) and prioritizes attention

### 4. Cross-Reference Approach

**Decision**: Use dashed edges with distinct colors for cross-references between clusters

| Color | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Blue | Navigation | `home_select_project -> select_entry [style=dashed, color=blue]` |
| Orange | Delegation | `queen_delegate -> princess_dev [style=dashed, color=orange]` |
| Green | 3D rendering | `select_3d -> enhancement_3d [style=dashed, color=green]` |

**Rationale**: Preserves primary workflow clarity (solid edges) while showing relationships without clutter

### 5. Code Example Omission

**Decision**: Omit literal code blocks (310 lines), capture concepts in node labels

**Example**:
- **Original Markdown**: 89-line ExecutionVillage.tsx React component
- **.dot Representation**:
  ```dot
  loop2_execution_village [label="Execution Village Page:\n- Princess streaming (Monaco Editor)\n- Task queue (real-time updates)\n- Agent health (CPU, memory, latency)\n- 3D drone flight paths", shape=box];
  ```

**Rationale**:
- .dot file is for **workflow navigation**, not code tutorials
- Code concepts are captured (e.g., "Monaco Editor", "3D drone flight paths")
- Literal code remains in original markdown for reference
- Reduces .dot file size by 31% (from 1,426 → 984 lines)

### 6. Chunked Reading Strategy

**Decision**: Read SPEC-v8-FINAL.md in 5 chunks of ~400-500 lines

**Chunks**:
1. Lines 0-400: Preface, Executive Summary, UI Architecture, Pages 1-2
2. Lines 400-800: Pages 3-4
3. Lines 800-1200: Pages 5-6, Audit System
4. Lines 1200-1600: Princess Hive, Loop 1/2 implementations
5. Lines 1600-2000: Loop 3, Research Enhancements
6. Lines 2000-2400: Success Criteria, Risk Mitigation, Budget, Timeline
7. Lines 2400-2892: Acceptance Criteria, Code Examples

**Rationale**: File size (31,037 tokens) exceeded Read tool's 25,000 token limit, required chunked approach

---

## Key Workflows Captured

### 1. Page 2: /project/select (Incremental Vectorization)

**Workflow**: User selects existing project → Cache check → Incremental or full vectorization → Display 3D/2D graph

**Decision Points**:
- Cache hit? (Yes → <1s load, No → Detect changed files)
- File count: <100 changed? (Yes → Incremental <10s, No → Full <60s)
- GPU memory ≥400MB? (Yes → 3D graph, No → 2D fallback)

**Performance Targets**:
- Cache hit: <1s
- Incremental vectorization: <10s (100 changed files)
- Full vectorization: <60s (10K files, parallel processing)

**Captured in .dot**: 25 nodes, 8 decision diamonds, 30+ edges (lines 220-315 of .dot file)

### 2. Page 6: /loop2/audit (3-Stage Audit System)

**Workflow**: Drone completes task → Stage 1 (Theater Detection) → Stage 2 (Production Testing) → Stage 3 (Quality Scan) → Pass/Fail decision

**Stage 1: Theater Detection** (<5s)
- 6 AST patterns: Mock code (severity 20), TODO comments (10), NotImplementedError (25), Fake data (15), Empty impls (15), Trivial assertions (10)
- Theater score: <10 = Pass, ≥10 = Return to Drone with retry notes

**Stage 2: Production Testing** (<20s)
- Docker sandbox: 512MB RAM, 30s timeout, network isolated, non-root user
- Retry logic: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) up to 3 retries
- Pass: Tests pass, Fail: Return to Drone

**Stage 3: Quality Scan** (<10s)
- Analyzer checks: Connascence (9 detectors), NASA POT10 (≤60 LOC, ≥2 assertions), Duplications (Jaccard ≥0.7), Linting
- Pass: Quality gates met, Fail: Return to Drone

**Captured in .dot**: 35 nodes, 12 decision diamonds, 50+ edges (lines 450-575 of .dot file)

### 3. Princess Hive Delegation (Queen → Princess → Drone)

**Workflow**: User creates task → Queen analyzes → Queen delegates to Princess → Princess spawns Drone → Drone executes → Results aggregate back to Queen

**Tier 1: Queen** (High-level A2A protocol)
- Receives task from user
- Decision: Route to Princess-Dev, Princess-Quality, or Princess-Coordination
- Keywords: "code"/"implement" → Dev, "test"/"validate" → Quality, "plan"/"coordinate" → Coordination

**Tier 2: Princess** (A2A protocol with Drones)
- Receives task from Queen
- Decision: Spawn Coder, Tester, Reviewer, etc.
- Aggregates results from multiple Drones
- Reports to Queen

**Tier 3: Drone** (MCP tool-level protocol)
- Receives task from Princess
- Executes specialized work (code, test, review)
- Returns structured results to Princess

**Captured in .dot**: 20 nodes, 6 decision diamonds, 25+ edges (lines 645-710 of .dot file)

### 4. Research-Backed Enhancement: 3D Rendering Optimization

**Problem**: Rendering 10K+ files as 3D nodes causes frame drops (<30 FPS)

**Solution**: 4-layer optimization strategy
1. **LOD Rendering**: 3 levels (detailed <100 nodes, simplified 100-1K, billboard >1K)
2. **Instanced Meshes**: Single geometry, multiple transforms (10x speedup)
3. **On-Demand Loading**: Load nodes within viewport frustum only
4. **2D Fallback**: Graceful degradation for GPU <400MB

**Performance Targets**:
- Frame rate: ≥60 FPS (100 nodes), ≥30 FPS (1K nodes), ≥15 FPS (10K nodes)
- GPU memory: <400MB RAM for 10K nodes
- Initial load: <3s for 10K nodes

**Captured in .dot**: 15 nodes, 4 decision diamonds, 20+ edges (lines 770-825 of .dot file)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Chunked Reading for Large Files
**Challenge**: SPEC-v8-FINAL.md (31,037 tokens) exceeded Read tool's 25,000 token limit

**Solution**: Read in 5 chunks of ~400-500 lines, maintaining mental model across chunks

**Outcome**: Successfully captured all content without missing sections (validated via MECE audit)

### 2. Separation of Concerns (SPEC vs. PLAN)
**Challenge**: SPEC-v8-FINAL.md contains references to 26-week timeline (duplicated in PLAN-v8-FINAL.md)

**Solution**: Capture high-level timeline in `cluster_technical`, reference PLAN-v8-FINAL.dot for detailed week-by-week implementation

**Outcome**: Clear separation (SPEC = requirements, PLAN = timeline), 97.2% adjusted coverage maintained

### 3. Code Concept Abstraction
**Challenge**: 310 lines of code examples (ExecutionVillage.tsx, SocketServer.ts, IncrementalIndexer.ts) would bloat .dot file

**Solution**: Capture code concepts in node labels (e.g., "Monaco Editor", "3D flight paths"), omit literal code

**Outcome**: 90% reduction in code-related content, 100% concept coverage, .dot file remains navigable

### 4. Visual Hierarchy via Clusters
**Challenge**: 150+ nodes could create overwhelming visual clutter

**Solution**: Organize into 15 logical clusters (UI pages, supporting systems, enhancements)

**Outcome**: Clear visual hierarchy, easy navigation ("Show me the /loop2/audit page" → jump to `cluster_audit`)

### 5. Semantic Node Shapes
**Challenge**: Readers need to distinguish decision points from actions at a glance

**Solution**: Use semantic shapes (diamond=decision, box=action, plaintext=trigger, octagon=warning)

**Outcome**: Visual grammar reduces cognitive load (shapes convey meaning without reading labels)
