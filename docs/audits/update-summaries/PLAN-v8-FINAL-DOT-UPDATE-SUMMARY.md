## What Was NOT Converted (Intentional)

### 1. Code Examples (Lines 363-397, 422-507, 533-593, 723-774, 923-1013, 1057-1126)

**Total**: 395 lines of TypeScript/Python code across 6 sections

**Reason Not Included**:
- GraphViz .dot is for **workflow navigation**, not code tutorials
- Code examples are implementation details, not process flows
- Users will reference original PLAN-v8-FINAL.md for code during implementation
- Including code would bloat .dot file without workflow value

**Coverage Impact**: Intentional exclusion (no change to 97.2%)

---

### 2. Detailed Checklist Items (Lines 356-704)

**Total**: ~50 granular checklist items (e.g., "Provision Redis instance", "Configure connection pooling")

**Reason Not Included**:
- GraphViz .dot shows **high-level workflow**, not day-to-day task tracking
- Checklists are for execution tracking, not plan navigation
- .dot file provides entry points (e.g., week4_monday), original markdown provides checklists
- Users will reference original PLAN-v8-FINAL.md for daily tasks

**Coverage Impact**: Intentional exclusion (no change to 97.2%)

---

### 3. Team Structure Details (Lines 240-273)

**Total**: 4 team descriptions (Team A, B, C, D with 10 developers)

**Reason Partially Included**:
- High-level team counts included in budget_development node
- Specific team assignments (Team D → Week 4 Monday) are implicit in week descriptions
- Explicit team → week mapping not critical for workflow navigation

**Coverage Impact**: Minor gap (90% team coverage, contributes to 97.2% overall)

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Semantic Node Shapes

**Shapes Used**:
- `[shape=box]`: Actions to execute (e.g., week4_monday, week7_nextjs)
- `[shape=diamond]`: Decisions/questions (e.g., week4_gate_check, week7_gate_check)
- `[shape=octagon]`: Critical warnings/blockers (e.g., week4_fail, week6_blocker)
- `[shape=plaintext]`: Trigger conditions (e.g., week12_trigger, week34_trigger)
- `[shape=ellipse]`: Entry points (start)
- `[shape=doublecircle]`: Exit points (end)

**Rationale**: Semantic shapes make workflow intent clear at a glance

---

### 2. Color Coding

**Colors Used**:
- `fillcolor=lightgreen`: Completed weeks (Weeks 1-7, 13-18)
- `fillcolor=lightyellow`: Future weeks (Weeks 8, 9-26)
- `fillcolor=orange`: Important weeks (Week 7 3D gate, Week 15 Playwright, Week 23 launch gate)
- `fillcolor=red`: Critical weeks (Week 4 infrastructure, Week 23 load testing)
- `fillcolor=lightblue`: Buffer weeks (14.5, 22.5, 25-26)

**Rationale**: Color coding communicates status and priority instantly

---

### 3. Cluster Organization

**24 Clusters Created**:
- `cluster_overview`: Project overview
- `cluster_week12` through `cluster_week2526`: 18 week clusters
- `cluster_critical_path`: Dependencies
- `cluster_risk_timeline`: Risk mitigation mapping
- `cluster_success_metrics`: Per-week KPIs
- `cluster_budget_timeline`: Budget breakdown
- `cluster_timeline_summary`: v7 vs v8 comparison
- `cluster_conclusion`: Key takeaways

**Rationale**: Clusters group related nodes for visual organization and improved readability

---

### 4. Edge Types

**3 Edge Types**:
1. **Solid edges** (normal flow): Sequential workflow (e.g., week4_monday -> week4_tuesday)
2. **Dashed edges** (cross-references): Links to related sections (e.g., risk_3d -> week7_gate_check)
3. **Labeled edges** (decision outcomes): Diamond decisions (e.g., week4_gate_check -> week4_pass [label="ALL PASSED"])

**Rationale**: Different edge types distinguish sequential flow from analytical cross-references

---

### 5. Trigger-Based Organization

**Triggers for Every Week**:
```dot
week12_trigger [label="TRIGGER:\nWeek 1-2 Kickoff", shape=plaintext, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow]
week34_trigger [label="TRIGGER:\nWeek 3-4 Kickoff\n(CRITICAL GATE)", shape=plaintext, style=filled, fillcolor=red]
...
```

**Rationale**: Plaintext triggers clearly mark entry conditions for each workflow phase

---

## GraphViz Rendering

### Recommended Rendering Engine

**Use `dot` layout engine**:
```bash
dot -Tpng plan-v8-final.dot -o plan-v8-final.png
dot -Tsvg plan-v8-final.dot -o plan-v8-final.svg
dot -Tpdf plan-v8-final.dot -o plan-v8-final.pdf
```

**Why `dot`**: Hierarchical layout engine best suited for workflow diagrams with clear top-to-bottom flow

### Alternative Engines

- `neato`: Force-directed layout (good for cross-references, but loses sequential flow)
- `fdp`: Force-directed with springs (similar to neato)
- `circo`: Circular layout (not suitable for linear timelines)
- `twopi`: Radial layout (not suitable for linear timelines)

**Recommendation**: Stick with `dot` for this workflow

---

## Usage Guide

### For Stakeholders

**Use Case**: "What's the project timeline and critical gates?"

**Navigation**:
1. Start at `cluster_overview` → See 26-week timeline, $270 budget, 3 critical gates
2. Jump to `cluster_critical_path` → See Week 4, 7, 23 dependencies
3. Jump to `cluster_timeline_summary` → See 82% on-time confidence

**Benefit**: 5-minute high-level overview without reading 1,475-line markdown

---

### For Developers

**Use Case**: "What do I need to implement in Week 4?"

**Navigation**:
1. Find `week34_trigger` → Entry point for Week 3-4
2. Follow sequential flow: `week4_monday` → `week4_tuesday` → `week4_wednesday` → `week4_thursday` → `week4_friday`
3. Check `week4_gate_check` → See all 3 critical components must pass
4. Reference original PLAN-v8-FINAL.md lines 331-704 for detailed checklists and code examples

**Benefit**: Clear workflow entry points, decision logic visible, detail in original markdown

---

### For Project Managers

**Use Case**: "What are the project risks and when are they mitigated?"

**Navigation**:
1. Jump to `cluster_risk_timeline` → See all 7 P1/P2 risks
2. Follow dashed orange edges to mitigation weeks:
   - `risk_websocket` → `week4_monday` (mitigated Week 4)
   - `risk_3d` → `week7_gate_check` (mitigated Week 7)
   - `risk_playwright` → `week15_config` (mitigated Week 15)
3. Check `cluster_critical_path` → See blocking relationships

**Benefit**: Risk mitigation visibility without spreadsheet tracking

---

### For QA Engineers

**Use Case**: "What are the success criteria for Week 23 load testing?"

**Navigation**:
1. Jump to `cluster_week2324` → See Week 23 launch gate
2. Check sequential flow: `week23_monday` (200 users) → `week23_tuesday` (10K files) → `week23_wednesday` (10 projects)
3. Jump to `metrics_week23` → See 4 KPIs (200 users <50ms, 10K <60s, 99% sync, zero leaks)
4. Follow dashed green edge from `metrics_week23` to `week24_gate_check` → See all tests must pass

**Benefit**: Clear test scope and acceptance criteria

---

## Improvements Over Original Markdown

### 1. Visual Navigation (vs Linear Text)

**Markdown**: Linear 1,475-line document, must read sequentially
**GraphViz**: Visual clusters and cross-references, jump directly to relevant sections

**Example**: Want to see Week 7 3D gate? Jump to `cluster_week7` and follow `week7_gate_check` diamond.

---

### 2. Decision Logic Clarity (vs Prose Descriptions)

**Markdown**: Decision logic described in prose paragraphs
**GraphViz**: Diamond nodes with labeled edges showing all outcomes

**Example**: Week 4 gate check has 2 outcomes visible at a glance:
- ALL PASSED → week4_pass → proceed to Week 5
- ANY FAILED → week4_fail → blocks Week 5+

---

### 3. Dependency Visualization (vs Text References)

**Markdown**: Dependencies mentioned in text ("Week 4 blocks Week 5+")
**GraphViz**: Dashed cross-reference edges showing exact dependencies

**Example**: `critical_week4` → `week4_monday` dashed edge shows Week 4 critical path dependency

---

### 4. Risk Mitigation Mapping (vs List Format)

**Markdown**: Risk mitigation described in bullet lists
**GraphViz**: Dashed orange edges connecting risks to mitigation weeks

**Example**: `risk_playwright` → `week15_config` shows exactly when Playwright timeout risk is mitigated

---

### 5. Status Clarity (vs Text Labels)

**Markdown**: Status described with text (✅ COMPLETE, IN PROGRESS, Future)
**GraphViz**: Color-coded clusters (lightgreen = complete, lightyellow = future, orange = important, red = critical)

**Example**: Week 5 cluster is lightgreen (complete), Week 8 cluster is lightyellow (in progress)

---

## Integration with Other Processes

### Cross-References to Other .dot Files

**Existing**:
- `atlantis-ui-implementation.dot` (Week 7 Atlantis UI details)

**Future** (to be created):
- `spec-v8-final.dot` → Requirements and acceptance criteria
- `agent-api-reference.dot` → Agent task types and payloads
- `princess-delegation-guide.dot` → Agent routing logic

**Cross-Reference Pattern**:
```dot
// In plan-v8-final.dot
week8_router [label="Implement tRPC router:\n- Project CRUD\n- Agent execution\n- Task tracking"]

// Future: Link to spec-v8-final.dot
week8_router -> spec_trpc_requirements [style=dashed, color=blue, ltail=cluster_week8, lhead=cluster_spec_trpc]
```
