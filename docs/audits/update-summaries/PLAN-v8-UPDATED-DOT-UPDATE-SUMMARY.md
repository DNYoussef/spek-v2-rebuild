## Overview

Successfully converted PLAN-v8-UPDATED.md to a comprehensive GraphViz .dot workflow capturing Week 18 progress (69.2% complete) and complete roadmap for Weeks 19-26. The .dot file provides detailed tracking of all completed work (Weeks 1-18) and clear planning for remaining work with critical gates.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Progress-Centric Organization (14 Clusters)

Organized into 14 major clusters focused on progress tracking:

1. **UPDATE SUMMARY**: Week 18 status (69.2% complete, 30,658 LOC, 89.6% NASA, 100% type-safe), next steps (19-26), key achievements
2. **WEEKS 1-4 INFRASTRUCTURE**: Complete foundation (AgentContract, Governance, WebSocket, Vectorization, Sandbox, Caching, Integration, 3,558 LOC total)
3. **WEEK 5 AGENTS**: 22 agents day-by-day (Day 1: NASA refactoring, Days 2-3: Core 5, Day 4: Princess 3, Days 5-6: Specialized 14, Day 7: Integration, 251 tests)
4. **WEEKS 6-18 COMPLETE**: Atlantis UI + E2E (DSPy Week 6, UI Week 7, +6 agents 8-9, Backend 10-12, 3D 13-17, E2E 18)
5. **WEEKS 19-20 PLANNED**: Context DNA + storage (30-day retention, <200ms search, 50MB/month growth)
6. **WEEKS 21-22 OPTIONAL**: DSPy expansion (P1 agents, A/B testing, ROI decision)
7. **WEEKS 23-24 CRITICAL GATE**: Load testing (50 users, 1000 tasks/hour) + production validation
8. **WEEKS 25-26 CONTINGENCY**: Contingency reserve + production launch
9. **QUALITY GATES (5)**: Week 4, 5-6, 7-9, 10-12 passed, Week 23 pending
10. **RISK MITIGATION**: Weeks 1-4 resolved, 5-6 mitigated, 7-9 mitigated, remaining monitored
11. **BUDGET & RESOURCES**: Phase 1 $55/month maintained, Phase 2 $225/month conditional (not triggered), actual spend $55/month
12. **SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Weeks 1-4, 5-6, 7-9, 10-12, 18 complete, 19-26 pending
13. **GO/NO-GO DECISION**: Production readiness HIGH, risk level LOW, 95% confidence GO
14. **NEXT STEPS**: Weeks 19-26 detailed roadmap

**Rationale**: Week 18 update requires clear visibility into what's complete, what's next, and decision points.

### 2. Day-by-Day Week 5 Breakdown

Created detailed 7-day breakdown for Week 5 agent implementation:
- **Day 1**: NASA refactoring (3 specific functions split to <60 LOC)
- **Days 2-3**: Core agents (5) with 75 tests
- **Day 4**: Princess coordinators (3) with 36 tests
- **Days 5-6**: Specialized agents (14) with 140 tests
- **Day 7**: Integration testing (251 total tests)

**Rationale**: Week 5 was a critical milestone (22 agents in 7 days), day-by-day tracking shows execution precision.

### 3. Triple-Status Color Coding

Applied strategic color coding for 3 status levels:
- **lightgreen**: Completed items (Weeks 1-18, all resolved risks, passed gates)
- **lightyellow**: Planned future work (Weeks 19-26, pending success criteria)
- **orange**: Critical decision points (Week 23 gate, DSPy ROI decision, remaining risks)
- **red**: Failure paths (Week 23 gate fail, DSPy rollback, NO-GO path)

**Rationale**: Visual status indicators enable rapid scanning of project health and critical decision points.

### 4. Critical Gate Workflow with Retry Logic

Created complete Week 23 load testing gate workflow:
- **Week 23 node**: Load testing details (50 users, 1000 tasks/hour, system stability, resource limits, performance metrics)
- **Gate diamond**: "Load testing PASSED?"
- **Pass path**: Proceed to Week 24 production validation
- **Fail path**: Optimize bottlenecks â†’ Retry with Week 25 buffer
- **Retry edge**: Dashed edge from fail back to Week 23 for retest

**Rationale**: Week 23 is the last critical gate before production launch, explicit failure handling with contingency buffer essential.

### 5. Quantified Metrics Throughout

Included specific quantified metrics in node labels:
- Progress: "Week 18: 69.2% complete", "30,658 LOC delivered"
- Infrastructure: "Week 4 Day 1: 740 LOC TypeScript", "15x speedup", ">80% cache hit rate"
- Agents: "22/22 agents operational", "251 comprehensive tests", "<100ms coordination latency"
- UI: "32 components (2,548 LOC)", "60 FPS maintained", "<3s page load all pages"
- E2E: "17/17 tests passing", "Full workflow validated"
- Budget: "$55/month Phase 1 maintained", "No Phase 2 expansion"
- Risk: "All P0/P1 risks resolved", "P2 risks mitigated"

**Rationale**: Progress tracking relies on quantified evidence, not qualitative statements.

  â†’ Week 23: Load Testing
    â†’ 50 concurrent users (target)
    â†’ 1000 tasks/hour (stress test)
    â†’ System stability validation
    â†’ Resource limit testing
    â†’ Performance metrics collection

    [Pass 88% threshold] â†’ Week 24: Production Validation
      â†’ Security hardening
      â†’ Monitoring setup
      â†’ Backup procedures
      â†’ Documentation finalization
      â†’ Deployment preparation
      â†’ Exit
    [Fail] â†’ Optimize bottlenecks
      â†’ Identify performance issues
      â†’ Apply fixes
      â†’ Retry Week 23 load testing (using Week 25 buffer)
      â†’ Loop back to Week 23
```

**Gate criteria**:
- **Pass**: 50 concurrent users stable, 1000 tasks/hour achieved, no resource exhaustion
- **Fail**: System instability, task throughput <800/hour, memory/CPU limits exceeded
- **Contingency**: Week 25 provides buffer for retry (1 week to fix + retest)
